o night and death , to whom we grudged him then
when in man 's sight he stood not yet undone
your king , your priest , your saviour , and your son
we grudge not now , who know that not again
ABBA
shall this curse come upon the sins of men
nor this face look upon the living sun
that shall behold not so abhorred an one
in all the days whereof his eye takes ken
ABBA
the bond is cancelled , and the prayer is heard
that seemed so long but weak and wasted breath
take him , for he is yours , o night and death
hell yawns on him whose life was as a word
ABBA
she looked at him with almost haughty air
to think that to reprove her he should dare
then fearlessly as some undaunted child
she met his eyes that searched her own for truth
AABB
and there with rapt eyes looking up to him
she told him of those visions never dim
of that wild spirit born amid the storm
whose restless strength had swayed her fragile form
AABB
but first , by reason let me prove , i pray
that evil such as this , and which you say
oft weighs you down with soul corroding care
is only in the mind :— mere spright of air
AABB
your hat upon your head for instance place
less gently rather than 's your usual case
pray , do n't it presently at ease remain
and from it do you aught amiss retain
AABB
not e'en a spot ; there 's nothing half so clear
the features , too , they as before appear
no difference assuredly you see
then how can cuckoldom an evil be
AABB
he rose — and slowly , sternly thence withdrew
rage in his eye , and threats in his adieu
ah ! little recked that chief of womanhood
which frowns ne'er quelled , nor menaces subdued
AABB
and little deemed he what thy heart , gulnare
when soft could feel — and when incensed could dare
his doubts appeared to wrong — nor yet she knew
how deep the root from whence compassion grew
AABB
she was a slave — from such may captives claim
a fellow feeling , differing but in name
still half unconscious — heedless of his wrath
again she ventured on the dangerous path
AABB
he spoke , and bade the sad attendants round
cleanse the pale corse , and wash each honour ’ d wound
a massy caldron of stupendous frame
they brought , and placed it o ’ er the rising flame
AABB
then heap ’ d the lighted wood ; the flame divides
beneath the vase , and climbs around the sides
in its wide womb they pour the rushing stream
the boiling water bubbles to the brim
AABB
the body then they bathe with pious toil
embalm the wounds , anoint the limbs with oil
high on a bed of state extended laid
and decent cover ’ d with a linen shade
AABB
he fought in vain ; and on this spot went down
the jus divinum , and the kingly crown
but for those scenes time long has made amends
the ancient enemies are present friends
AABB
two swords , in massachusetts , rich in dust
and , better still , the peacefulness of rust
told the whole story in its double parts
to one who lives in two great nations ’ hearts
AABB
and late above old england 's roar and din
slow tolling bells spoke sympathy of kin
victoria 's wreath blooms on the sleeping breast
of him just gone to his reward and rest
AABB
i heard in my slumbers the ceaseless roar
of the sparkling waves , as they met the shore
till lulled by the surge of the moon lit deep
by the heaving ocean i sank to sleep
AABB
and a magic spell on my spirit was cast
and forms that had perished in ages past
were by fancy revealed to my wondering view
as the veil of oblivion she backward drew
AABB
and showed me a glorious vision , dressed
in the rosy light of the glowing west
such colours at parting the day god throws
to gild his path , as rejoicing he goes
AABB
but chiefly , conscious of thy promised throne
intent to grace that destiny sublime
thou sought'st to make the historic page thine own
and win the treasures of recorded time
ABAB
the forms of polity , the springs of power
exploring still with inexhausted zeal
still , the pole star which led thy studious hour
through thought 's unfolding tracts — thy country 's weal
ABAB
while fancy , radiant with unearthly charms
thus breathed the whisper wisdom sanctified
“ eliza 's , anna 's glories , arts , or arms
beneath thy sway shall blaze revivified
ABAB
were this to happen now , scamander 's stream
would not so easily preserve esteem
but crimes like these ( whoever was abused
in former days , were easily excused
AABB
with time our maxims change , and what was then
though wrong at present , may prevail agen
scamander 's spouse some raillery received
but in the end she fully was relieved
AABB
a lover e'en superior thought her charms
( his taste was such ) and took her to his arms
the gods can nothing spoil ! but should they cause
a belle to lose a portion of applause
AABB
this holy season *, fit to fast and pray
men to devotion ought to be inclynd
therefore , i lykewise , on so holy day
for my sweet saynt some service fit will find
ABAB
fire out of heaven , a flower of perfect fire
that where the roots of life are had its root
and where the fruits of time are brought forth fruit
a faith made flesh , a visible desire
ABBA
that heard the yet unbreathing years respire
and speech break forth of centuries that sit mute
beyond all feebler footprint of pursuit
that touched the highest of hope , and went up higher
ABBA
a heart love wounded whereto love was law
a soul reproachless without fear or flaw
a shining spirit without shadow of shame
a memory made of all men 's love and awe
AABB
it now remains for you to school your child
and ask why god 's anointed he reviled
a king and princess dead ! did shimei worse
the cursor 's punishment should fright the curse
AABB
your son was warn 'd , and wisely gave it o'er
but he who counsell 'd him has paid the score
the heavy malice could no higher tend
but woe to him on whom the weights descend
AABB
so to permitted ills the demon flies
his rage is aim 'd at him who rules the skies
constrain 'd to quit his cause , no succour found
the foe discharges every tire around
AABB
heaven bless the new year that is just ushered in
may the rebels repent of their folly and sin
depart from their idols , extend the right hand
and pledge that the union forever shall stand
AABB
may they see that the rending of fetter and chain
is their triumph as well — their unspeakable gain
that the union dissevered and weltering in blood
could yield them no profit and bode them no good
AABB
‘ tis human to err and divine to forgive
let us walk after christ — bid the poor sinners live
and come back to the fold of the union once more
and we 'll do as the prodigal 's father of yore
AABB
the romans first with julius caesar came
including all the nations of that name
gauls , greeks , and lombards , and , by computation
auxiliaries or slaves of every nation
AABB
with hengist , saxons ; danes with sueno came
in search of plunder , not in search of fame
scots , picts , and irish from th ’ hibernian shore
and conquering william brought the normans o'er
AABB
all these their barbarous offspring left behind
the dregs of armies , they of all mankind
blended with britons , who before , were here
of whom the welsh ha ’ blessed the character
AABB
the bold bavarian , in a luckless hour
tries the dread summits of cesarean pow'r
with unexpected legions bursts away
and sees defenceless realms receive his sway
AABB
short sway ! fair austria spreads her mournful charms
the queen , the beauty , sets the world in arms
from hill to hill the beacons rousing blaze
spreads wide the hope of plunder and of praise
AABB
the fierce croatian , and the wild hussar
and all the sons of ravage croud the war
the baffled prince in honour 's flatt'ring bloom
of hasty greatness finds the fatal doom
AABB
if you want a receipt for this soldierlike paragon
get at the wealth of the czar ( if you can
the family pride of a spaniard from arragon
force of mephisto pronouncing a ban
ABAB
a smack of lord waterford , reckless and rollicky
swagger of roderick , heading his clan
the keen penetration of paddington pollaky
grace of an odalisque on a divan
ABAB
and settle on white pages wing to wing
white pages like flower petals fluttering
held spellbound there till some blind hour shall bring
the perfect voice that , delicate and wise
ABAB
the sly enchanter when to work his will
and secret wrong on some forespoken wight
frames wax in form to represent aright
the poor unwitting wretch he means to kill
ABBA
and pricks the image framed by magic 's skill
whereby to vex the party day and night
like hath she done , whose show bewitched my sight
to beauty 's charms , her lover 's blood to spill
ABBA
for first , like wax she framed me by her eyes
whose rays sharp pointed set upon my breast
martyr my life and plague me in this wise
with ling'ring pain to perish in unrest
ABAB
thro each colonial realm , for wisdom great
elected sires assume the cares of state
nursed in equality , to freedom bred
firm is their step and straight the paths they tread
AABB
dispensing justice with paternal hand
by laws of peace they rule the happy land
while reason 's page their statute codes unfold
and rites and charters flame in figured gold
AABB
all rights that britons know they here transfuse
their sense invigorate and expand their views
dare every height of human soul to scan
find , fathom , scope the moral breadth of man
AABB
the good shah akbar ( peace be his alway
came forth from the divan at close of day
bowed with the burden of his many cares
worn with the hearing of unnumbered prayers
AABB
wild cries for justice , the importunate
appeals of greed and jealousy and hate
and all the strife of sect and creed and rite
santon and gouroo waging holy fight
AABB
for the wise monarch , claiming not to be
allah 's avenger , left his people free
with a faint hope , his book scarce justified
that all the paths of faith , though severed wide
AABB
the spark concealed himself ; each charm admired
now this , now that , now t'other feature fired
a hundred beauties caught his eager sight
and while his bosom felt supreme delight
AABB
he turned his thoughts advantages to take
and of the maiden 's error something make
assumed the character , and dress ; and air
that should a wat'ry deity declare
AABB
within the gliding flood his vestments dipt
a crown of rushes on his head he slipt
aquatick herbs and plants around he twined
then mercury intreated to be kind
AABB
at midnight when the moonlit cypress trees
have woven round his grave a magic shade
still weeping the unfinished hymn he made
there moves fresh maia like a morning breeze
ABBA
blown over jonquil beds when warm rains cease
and stooping where her poet 's head is laid
selene weeps while all the tides are stayed
and swaying seas are darkened into peace
ABBA
but they who wake the meadows and the tides
have hearts too kind to bid him wake from sleep
who murmurs sometimes when his dreams are deep
startling the quiet land where he abides
ABBA
o opulent life of ours , though dispossessed
of treasure after treasure ! youth most fair
went first , but left its priceless coil of hair
moaned over sleepless nights , kissed and caressed
ABBA
through drip and blur of tears the tenderest
and next went love — the ripe rose glowing there
her very sister !... it is here ; but where
is she , of all the world the first and best
ABBA
fair eyes , whilst fearful i your fair admire
by unexpress è d sweetness that i gain
my memory of sorrow doth expire
and falcon like , i tower joy 's heavens amain
ABAB
but when your suns in oceans of their glory
shut up their day bright shine , i die for thought
so pass my joys as doth a new played story
and one poor sigh breathes all delight to naught
ABAB
so to myself i live not , but for you
for you i live , and you i love , but none else
oh then , fair eyes , whose light i live to view
or poor forlorn despised to live alone else
ABAB
pardon , oh , pardon , that my soul should make
of all that strong divineness which i know
for thine and thee , an image only so
formed of the sand , and fit to shift and break
ABBA
it is that distant years which did not take
thy sovranty , recoiling with a blow
have forced my swimming brain to undergo
their doubt and dread , and blindly to forsake
ABBA
thy purity of likeness and distort
thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit
as if a shipwrecked pagan , safe in port
his guardian sea god to commemorate
ABAB
when first the sun whom all my senses serve
began to shine upon this earthly round
the heavens for her all graces did reserve
that pandor like with all she might abound
ABAB
apollo placed his brightness in her eyes
his skill presaging and his music sweet
mars gave his force ; all force she now defies
venus her smiles wherewith she mars did meet
ABAB
python a voice , diana made her chaste
ceres gave plenty , cupid lent his bow
thetis his feet , there pallas wisdom placed
with these she queen like kept a world in awe
ABAB
the castle gate stands open now
and the wanderer is welcome to the hall
as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough
no longer scowl the turrets tall
ABAB
the summer 's long siege at last is o'er
when the first poor outcast went in at the door
she entered with him in disguise
and mastered the fortress by surprise
AABB
there is no spot she loves so well on ground
she lingers and smiles there the whole year round
the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land
has hall and bower at his command
AABB
trained in the holy art whose lifted shield
wards off the darts a never slumbering foe
by hearth and wayside lurking , waits to throw
oppression taught his helpful arm to wield
ABBA
the slayer 's weapon : on the murderous field
the fiery bolt he challenged laid him low
seeking its noblest victim . even so
the charter of a nation must be sealed
ABBA
the healer 's brow the hero 's honors crowned
from lowliest duty called to loftiest deed
living , the oak leaf wreath his temples bound
dying , the conqueror 's laurel was his meed
ABAB
here morning in the ploughman 's songs is met
ere yet one footstep shows in all the sky
and twilight in the east , a doubt as yet
shows not her sleeve of grey to know her bye
ABAB
woke early , i arose and thought that first
in winter time of all the world was i
the old owls might have hallooed if they durst
but joy just then was up and whistled bye
ABAB
a merry tune which i had known full long
but could not to my memory wake it back
until the ploughman changed it to the song
o happiness , how simple is thy track
ABAB
the sultaun enter 'd , and he made his leg
and with decorum courtesy 'd sister peg
( she loved a book , and knew a thing or two
and guess 'd at once with whom she had to do
AABB
she bade him “ sit into the fire , ” and took
her dram , her cake , her kebbuck from the nook
ask 'd him “ about the news from eastern parts
and of her absent bairns , puir highland hearts
AABB
if peace brought down the price of tea and pepper
and if the nitmugs were grown ony cheaper
were there nae speerings of our mungo park
ye 'll be the gentleman that wants the sark
AABB
glory beyond all flight of warlike fame
go with the warrior 's memory who preferred
to praise of men whereby men 's hearts are stirred
and acclamation of his own proud name
ABBA
with blare of trumpet blasts and sound and flame
of pageant honour , and the titular word
that only wins men worship of the herd
his country 's sovereign good ; who overcame
ABBA
pride , wrath , and hope of all high chance on earth
for this land 's love that gave his great heart birth
o nursling of the sea winds and the sea
immortal england , goddess ocean born
AABB
now , mark you , libeler , this course if you
dare to maintain , or rather to renew
if one short year 's immunity has made
you blink again the perils of your trade
AABB
the ghastly sequence of the maddened “ knave
the hot encounter and the colder grave
if the grim , dismal lesson you ignore
while yet the stains are fresh upon your floor
AABB
and calmly march upon the fatal brink
with eyes averted to your trail of ink
counting unkind the services of those
who pull , to hold you back , your stupid nose
AABB
when that brave honour of the latine name
which mear 'd * her rule with africa and byze
with thames inhabitants of noble fame
and they which see the dawning day arize
ABAB
of thetis i sing with her locks of gold shine
the daughter of nereus , lord of the brine
to peleus wedded , by jove 's high decree
i sing her , the venus so fair of the sea
AABB
of the spearman tremendous , the mars of the fight
thunderbolt of old greece , she was quickly made light
of achilles divine , to whom pyrrha an heir
the boy neoptolemus , gladly did bear
AABB
the destroyer of trojans , of grecians the shield
thy protection to us , neoptolemus yield
who blessed doth slumber in pythia 's green plain
to accept this oblation of hymns from us deign
AABB
guido , i would that lapo , thou , and i
led by some strong enchantment , might ascend
a magic ship , whose charmed sails should fly
with winds at will where'er our thoughts might wend
ABAB
so that no change , nor any evil chance
should mar our joyous voyage ; but it might be
that even satiety should still enhance
between our hearts their strict community
ABAB
and that the bounteous wizard then would place
vanna and bice and my gentle love
companions of our wandering , and would grace
with passionate talk , wherever we might rove
ABAB
next , to the court , impatient of delay
with rapid step the goddess urged her way
there every eye with slumberous chains she bound
and dash 'd the flowing goblet to the ground
AABB
“ lo ! on the seas , prepared the vessel stands
the impatient mariner thy speed demands
swift as she spoke , with rapid pace she leads
the footsteps of the deity he treads
AABB
charles ! my slow heart was only sad , when first
i scanned that face of feeble infancy
for dimly on my thoughtful spirit burst
all i had been , and all my child might be
ABAB
but when i saw it on its mother 's arm
and hanging at her bosom ( she the while
bent o'er its features with a tearful smile
then i was thrilled and melted , and most warm
ABBA
impressed a father 's kiss : and all beguiled
of dark remembrance and presageful fear
i seemed to see an angel form appear
‘ twas even thine , beloved woman mild
ABBA
conceptions beautiful , as faust drew wine
from the rude table ; for this friend of mine
was a true poet , though he seldom wrote
the wealth which might have royally endowed
AABB
sir ambrose higham , in his eightieth year
with memory unimpair 'd , and conscience clear
his english heart untrammell 'd , and full blown
his senatorial honours and renown
AABB
now , basking in his plenitude of fame
resolved , in concert with his noble dame
to drive to town no more — no more by night
to meet in crowded courts a blaze of light
AABB
in streets a roaring mob with flags unfurl 'd
and all the senseless discord of the world
but calmly wait the hour of his decay
the broad bright sunset of his glorious day
AABB
when i have borne in memory what has tamed
great nations , how ennobling thoughts depart
when men change swords for ledgers , and desert
the student 's bower for gold , some fears unnamed
ABBA
i had , my country !— am i to be blamed
but when i think of thee , and what thou art
verily , in the bottom of my heart
of those unfilial fears i am ashamed
ABBA
but dearly must we prize thee ; we who find
in thee a bulwark for the cause of men
and i by my affection was beguiled
what wonder if a poet now and then
ABAB
a cloud lay cradled near the setting sun
a gleam of crimson tinged its braided snow
long had i watched the glory moving on
o'er the still radiance of the lake below
ABAB
tranquil its spirit seemed , and floated slow
even in its very motion there was rest
while every breath of eve that chanced to blow
wafted the traveller to the beauteous west
ABAB
emblem , methought , of the departed soul
to whose white robe the gleam of bliss is given
and by the breath of mercy made to roll
right onwards to the golden gates of heaven
ABAB
here paused the witch to mend her glowing fire
while each man to his neighbour shuffled nigher
as witch flame leapt and ever brighter grew
till , to their horror , sudden it burned blue
AABB
whereat each silent , fearful beholder
felt in the gloom to touch his fellow 's shoulder
yet , in that moment , knew an added dread
to see the fire from blue turn ghastly red
AABB
then , as the witch did o'er it crooning lean
behold ! it changed again to baleful green
whereat the witch flung bony arms on high
as though with claw like hands she ‘ d rend the sky
AABB
dear , though from me your gratious looks depart
and of that comfort do myself bereave
which both i did deserve and did receive
triumph not over much in this my smart
ABBA
nay , rather they which now enjoy thy heart
for fear just cause of mourning should conceive
lest thou inconstant shouldst their trust deceive
which like unto the weather changing art
ABBA
for in foul weather birds sing often will
in hope of fair , and in fair time will cease
for fear fair time should not continue still
so they may mourn which have thy heart possessed
ABAB
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes
and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he
remembered in what a haughtier guise
he had flung an alms to leprosie
ABAB
when he girt his young life up in gilded mail
and set forth in search of the holy grail
the heart within him was ashes and dust
he parted in twain his single crust
AABB
he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink
and gave the leper to eat and drink
‘ twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread
‘ twas water out of a wooden bowl
AABB
i coude pleyne , thogh i were in the gilt
or elles often tyme hadde i ben spilt
who so that first to mille comth , first grint
i pleyned first , so was our werre y stint
AABB
between the two white breasts of her we love
a dewy blushing rose will sometimes spring
thus nonnenwerth like an enchanted thing
rises mid stream the crystal depths above
ABBA
on either side the waters heave and swell
but all is calm within the little isle
content it is to give its holy smile
and bless with peace the lives that in it dwell
ABBA
most dear on the dark grass beneath its bower
of kindred trees embracing branch and bough
to dream of fairy foot and sudden flower
or haply with a twilight on the brow
ABAB
i am no model figure , or sign of care
but his eternal heart'shyppphenconsuming essence
in whom grief 's commentaries written are
drawing gross passion into pure quintessence
ABAB
not thine eye 's fire , but fire of thine eye 's disdain
fed by neglect of my continual grieving
attracts the true life 's spirit of my pain
and gives it thee , which gives me no relieving
ABAB
within thine arms sad elegies i sing
unto thine eyes a true heart love torn lay i
thou smell'st from me the savours sorrows bring
my tears to taste my truth to touch display i
ABAB
there is a race which cold , ungenial skies
breed from decay , as fungous growths arise
though dying fast , yet springing fast again
which still usurps an unsubstantial reign
AABB
with frames too languid for the charms of sense
and minds worn down with action too intense
tired of a world whose joys they never knew
themselves deceived , yet thinking all untrue
AABB
scarce men without , and less than girls within
sick of their life before its cares begin
the dull disease , which drains their feeble hearts
to life 's decay some hectic thrill 's imparts
AABB
she did n't faint ; she knelt by my side
an ’ thanked the lord , till i fairly cried
an ’ maybe our ride was n't pleasant an ’ gay
an ’ maybe she was n't wrapped up that day
AABB
an ’ maybe our cottage was n't warm an ’ bright
an ’ maybe it was n't a pleasant sight
to see her a gettin ’ the evenin 's tea
an ’ frequently stoppin ’ and kissin ’ me
AABB
an ’ maybe we did n't live happy for years
in spite of my brothers ’ and sisters ’ sneers
who often said , as i have heard
that they would n't own a prison bird
AABB
i loved you first : but afterwards your love
outsoaring mine , sang such a loftier song
as drowned the friendly cooings of my dove
which owes the other most ? my love was long
ABAB
and yours one moment seemed to wax more strong
i loved and guessed at you , you construed me
and loved me for what might or might not be
nay , weights and measures do us both a wrong
ABBA
for verily love knows not “ mine ” or “ thine
with separate “ i ” and “ thou ” free love has done
for one is both and both are one in love
rich love knows nought of “ thine that is not mine
ABBA
who stood upon that schooner 's driven deck
last night as reefed and shuddering she hove
into the twilight and all desperate drove
from wave to angrier wave that sought her wreck
ABBA
who labored at her helm and watched the wind
stagger the sea with all his stunning might
until in dimness dwindling from our sight
she vanished in the wrack that rode behind
ABBA
we know not , you and i , but our two souls
that followed as storm petrels o'er the waves
felt all the might of him who sinks or saves
and all the pity of earth 's unreached goals
ABBA
fair was the maid , and lovely as the morn
from starry night and rosy twilight born
within whose mind a rivulet of song
rehearsed the strains that from her lips ere long
AABB
the health and beauty of her youthful face
made it the harem of each maiden grace
and such perfection blended with her air
she seemed some stately goddess moving there
AABB
there , while the muses wanton unconfined
and wreaths resplendent round their temples bind
‘ tis yours to strew their steps with votive flowers
to watch them slumbering ‘ midst the blissful bowers
AABB
to guard the shades that hide their sacred charms
and shield their beauties from unhallow 'd arms
oh ! may their suppliant steal a passing kiss
alas ! he pants not for superior bliss
AABB
when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days , in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent
ABBA
to serve therewith my maker , and present
my true account , lest he , returning , chide
“ doth god exact day labor , light denied
i fondly ask . but patience , to prevent
ABBA
that murmur , soon replies , “ god doth not need
either man 's work or his own gifts . who best
bear his mild yoke , they serve him best . his state
is kingly : thousands at his bidding speed
ABBA
so love be thou , although to day thou fill
thy hungry eyes , even till they wink with fulness
to morrow see again , and do not kill
the spirit of love , with a perpetual dulness
ABAB
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore , where two contracted new
come daily to the banks , that when they see
return of love , more blest may be the view
ABAB
“ but when the gods , frustrated , this beheld
how , living still , among the dead she dwelled
because she lived in him whose life she won
and her blood beat in his beneath the sun
AABB
they reasoned : ‘ when the bitter stygian wave
the sweetness of love 's kisses cannot lave
when the pale flood of lethe washes not
from mortal mind one high immortal thought
AABB
akin to us the earthly creature grows
since nature suffers only what it knows
if she whom we to this grey desert banned
still dreams she treads with him the sunlit land
AABB
to yon dim rounds first elevate thy view
see quito 's plains o'erlook their proud peru
on whose huge base , like isles amid sky driven
a vast protuberance props the cope of heaven
AABB
earth 's loftiest turrets there contend for height
and all our andes fill the bounded sight
from south to north what long blue swells arise
built thro the clouds , and lost in ambient skies
AABB
approaching slow they heave expanding bounds
the yielding concave bends sublimer rounds
whose wearied stars , high curving to the west
pause on the summits for a moment 's rest
AABB
no , not in vain he died — not all in vain
our good , great president ! this people 's hands
are linked together in one mighty chain
drawn tighter still in triple woven bands
ABAB
to crush the fiends in human masks , whose might
we suffer , oh , too long ! no league , nor truce
save men with men ! the devils we must fight
with fire ! god wills it in this deed . this use
ABAB
we draw from the most impious murder done
since calvary . rise then , o countrymen
scatter these marsh lights hopes of union won
through pardoning clemency . strike , strike again
ABAB
my love , and not i , is the egoist
my love for thee loves itself more than thee
ay , more than me , in whom it doth exist
and makes me live that it may feed on me
ABAB
this thought therefore comes lightly to doubt ’ s door
if we , seeing substance of this world , are not
mere intervals , god ’ s absence and no more
hollows in real consciousness and thought
ABAB
give me the treble of thy horns and hoofs
the ponderous undertones of ‘ bus and tram
a garret and a glimpse across the roofs
of clouds blown eastward over notre dame
ABAB
the glad eyed streets and radiant gatherings
where i drank deep the bliss of being young
the strife and sweet potential flux of things
i sought youth 's dream of happiness among
ABAB
it walks here aureoled with the city light
forever through the myriad featured mass
flaunting not far its fugitive embrace
heard sometimes in a song across the night
ABBA
laughing , “ to night , ” i said to him , “ the park
has turned the garden of a symbolist
those old great trees that rise above the mist
gold with the light of evening , and the dark
ABBA
still water , where the dying sun evokes
an echoed glory — here i recognize
those ancient gardens mirrored by the eyes
of poets that hate the world of common folks
ABBA
like you and me and that thin pious crowd
which yonder sings its hymns , so humbly proud
of holiness . the garden of escape
lies here ; a small green world , and still the bride
AABB
here the whole land doth scorching lye
under the glittering armes o ’ th ’ enemy
under the hovering stroke o ’ th ’ fates
the armies yet both stand ; and fury waites
AABB
so , since the winged god his planet cleare
began in me to move , one yeare is spent
the which doth longer unto me appeare
then al those fourty which my life out went
ABAB
what viewed i , dear , when i thine eyes beheld
love in his glory ? no , him thyrsis saw
and stood the boy , whilst he his darts did draw
whose painted pride to baser swains he telled
ABBA
saw i two suns ? that sight is seen but seld
yet can their brood that teach the holy law
gaze on their beams , and dread them not a straw
where princely looks are by their eyes repelled
ABBA
what saw i then ? doubtless it was amen
armed with strong thunder and a lightning 's flame
who bridegroom like with power was riding then
meaning that none should see him when he came
ABAB
her eyes swam fire , and her cheek was red
her full breast heaved as she darkly said
“ the coyote hides from the wind and rain
the wild horse flies from the hurricane
AABB
but who can flee from the half breed 's hate
that rises soon and that watches late
then went ; and i laughed jeanne 's fears afar
but i thought that wench was our evil star
AABB
i care not that one listen if he lives
for aught but life 's romance , nor puts above
all life 's necessities the need to love
nor counts his greatest wealth what beauty gives
ABBA
but sometime on an afternoon in spring
when dandelions dot the fields with gold
and under rustling shade a few weeks old
‘ tis sweet to stroll and hear the bluebirds sing
ABBA
do you , blond head , whom beauty and the power
of being young and winsome have prepared
for life 's last privilege that really pays
make the companion of an idle hour
ABBA
thou be my speed fro this forth , and my muse
to ryme wel this book , til i have do
me nedeth here noon other art to use
for why to every lovere i me excuse
AABB
safer with winds and waves than human wrath
with ravening wolves than those whose zeal for god
was cruelty to man , the exiles trod
drear leagues of forest without guide or path
ABBA
or launching frail boats on the uncharted sea
round storm vexed capes , whose teeth of granite ground
the waves to foam , their perilous way they wound
enduring all things so their souls were free
ABBA
oh , true confessors , shaming them who did
anew the wrong their pilgrim fathers bore
for you the mayflower spread her sail once more
freighted with souls , to all that duty bid
ABBA
so now i have confessed that he is thine
and i my self am mortgaged to thy will
my self i 'll forfeit , so that other mine
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
ABAB
but thou wilt not , nor he will not be free
for thou art covetous , and he is kind
he learned but surety like to write for me
under that bond that him as fist doth bind
ABAB
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer that put'st forth all to use
and sue a friend , came debtor for my sake
so him i lose through my unkind abuse
ABAB
upon a rock i sat — a mountain side
far , far forsaken of the old sea 's lip
a rock where ancient waters ’ rise and dip
recoil and plunge , eddy , and oscillant tide
ABBA
had worn and worn , while races lived and died
involved channels . where the sea weed 's drip
followed the ebb , now crumbling lichens sip
sparse dews of heaven that down with sunset slide
ABBA
i sat long gazing southward . a dry flow
of withering wind sucked up my drooping strength
itself weak from the desert 's burning length
behind me piled , away and up did go
ABBA
enrich yourselves and me by your self riches
which are the thoughts you spend on heaven bred beauty
rouse you my muse beyond our poets ’ pitches
and , working wonders , yet say all is duty
ABAB
use you no eaglets ’ eyes , nor phoenix ’ feathers
to tower the heaven from whence heaven 's wonder sallies
for why ? your sun sings sweetly to her weathers
making a spring of winter in the valleys
ABAB
dear unborn children , to our mother 's trust
we leave you , fearless , when we lie in dust
while o'er these walls the christian banner waves
from hallowed lips shall flow the truth that saves
AABB
while o'er those portals veritas you read
no church shall bind you with its human creed
take from the past the best its toil has won
but learn betimes its slavish ruts to shun
AABB
pass the old tree whose withered leaves are shed
quit the old paths that error loved to tread
and a new wreath of living blossoms seek
a narrower pathway up a loftier peak
AABB
when forty winters shall besiege thy brow
and dig deep trenches in thy beauty 's field
thy youth 's proud livery so gazed on now
will be a tattered weed of small worth held
ABAB
then being asked , where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days
to say within thine own deep sunken eyes
were an all eating shame , and thriftless praise
ABAB
how much more praise deserved thy beauty 's use
if thou couldst answer ‘ this fair child of mine
shall sum my count , and make my old excuse
proving his beauty by succession thine
ABAB
life ever seems as from its present site
it aimed to lure us . mountains of the past
it melts , with all their crags and caverns vast
into a purple cloud ! across the night
ABBA
which hides what is to be , it shoots a light
all rosy with the yet unrisen dawn
not the near daisies , but yon distant height
attracts us , lying on this emerald lawn
ABAB
and always , be the landscape what it may
blue , misty hill or sweep of glimmering plain
it is the eye 's endeavor still to gain
the fine , faint limit of the bounding day
ABBA
beneath thy midas touch life 's sullen grays
are thrilled to sudden gold ; as some far gleam
from wings of helios athwart thy dream
irradiates for thee earth 's darksome ways
ABBA
wild woodland voices ripple thro ’ thy lays
sweet silvern murmurs from some deep delled spring
brook , tree and flower and each insensate thing
the throstle 's call , the calm of sun steeped days
ABBA
a glint of sunshine on the swallow 's wing
fern filagrees , the drowsy drone of bee
made drunk with draughts of purple wild grape wine
all these orph è an music holds for thee
ABAB
upon an hill a bright flame i did see
waving aloft with triple point to skie
which , like incense of precious cedar tree
with balmie odours fil 'd th'ayre farre and nie
AABB
a bird all white , well feathered on each wing
hereout up to the throne of gods did flie
and all the way most pleasant notes did sing
whilst in the smoake she unto heaven did stie
ABAB
of this faire fire the scattered rayes forth threw
on everie side a thousand shining beames
when sudden dropping of a silver dew
( o grievous chance !) gan quench those precious flames
ABAB
the flower that 's gathered beauty soon forsakes
the bliss grows feeble as we gain the prize
love dreams of joy , and in possession wakes
scarce time enough to hail it ere it dies
ABAB
life intermingles , with its cares and sighs
and rapture 's dreams are ended . heavenly flower
it is not so with thee ! still fancy 's power
throws rainbow halos round thee , and thine eyes
ABBA
that once did steal their sapphire blue from even
are beaming on ; thy cheeks ’ bewitching dye
where partial roses all their blooms had given
still in fond memory with the rose can vie
ABAB
now friends conversing my soft hours refine
and tully 's tusculum revives in mine
now to grave books i bid the mind retreat
and such as make me rather good than great
AABB
or o'er the works of easy fancy rove
where flutes and innocence amuse the grove
the native bard that on sicilian plains
first sung the lowly manners of the swains
AABB
or maro 's muse , that in the fairest light
paints rural prospects and the charms of sight
these soft amusements bring content along
and fancy , void of sorrow , turns to song
AABB
ah ! changed and cold , how changed and very cold
with stiffened smiling lips and cold calm eyes
changed , yet the same ; much knowing , little wise
this was the promise of the days of old
ABBA
grown hard and stubborn in the ancient mould
grown rigid in the sham of lifelong lies
we hoped for better things as years would rise
but it is over as a tale once told
ABBA
all fallen the blossom that no fruitage bore
all lost the present and the future time
all lost , all lost , the lapse that went before
so lost till death shut to the opened door
AABB
when satisfied the smart gallant appeared
and anxiously to putting off adhered
pretending that the wind and tide would fail
the galleys sometimes were unfit to sail
AABB
repairs required ; then further heard the news
that certain pirates had unpleasant views
to fall upon the escort they 'd contrived
at length , a pirate suddenly arrived
AABB
surprized the party left upon the shore
destroyed the whole ; then sought the house for more
and scaled the walls while darkness spread around
the pirate was grifonio 's second found
AABB
he turns about to face the loud uproar
and drives the rebels to their very door
the frequent stone is hurled where eer they go
when badgers fight , then every one 's a foe
AABB
the dogs are clapt and urged to join the fray
the badger turns and drives them all away
though scarcely half as big , demure and small
he fights with dogs for bones and beats them all
AABB
the heavy mastiff , savage in the fray
lies down and licks his feet and turns away
the bulldog knows his match and waxes cold
the badger grins and never leaves his hold
AABB
last night her form the hours of slumber bless 'd
whose eyes illumin 'd all my youthful years
spirit of dreams , at thy command appears
each airy shape , that visiting our rest
ABBA
nightly i cry , how oft , alas ! in vain
give , by thy powers , that airy shapes controul
honora to my visions !— ah ! ordain
her beauteous lip may wear the smile that stole
ABAB
too , too prophetic did thy wild note swell
impassion 'd minstrel ! when its pitying wail
sigh 'd o'er the vernal primrose as it fell
untimely , wither 'd by the northern gale
ABAB
to see thee languish into quick decay
yet was not thy departing immature
for ripe in virtue thou wert reft away
and pure in spirit , as the bless 'd are pure
ABAB
“ there were but two , and we were forty ! yet
the captain wrote , “ that dauntless couple throve
and faced our wildering faces ; and i said
‘ lie to awhile ! ’ i did not choose to let
ABBA
we , like the leaf , the summit , or the wave
reflect the light our common nature gave
but every sunbeam , falling from her throne
wears on our hearts some coloring of our own
AABB
chilled in the slave , and burning in the free
like the sealed cavern by the sparkling sea
lost , like the lightning in the sullen clod
or shedding radiance , like the smiles of god
AABB
pure , pale in virtue , as the star above
or quivering roseate on the leaves of love
glaring like noontide , where it glows upon
ambition 's sands ,— the desert in the sun
AABB
sweet soul , which , in the april of thy years
for to enrich the heaven mad'st poor this round
and now , with flaming rays of glory crown 'd
most blest abides above the sphere of spheres
ABBA
if heavenly laws , alas ! have not thee bound
from looking to this globe that all upbears
if ruth and pity there above be found
oh , deign to lend a look unto these tears
ABAB
do not disdain , dear ghost , this sacrifice
and though i raise not pillars to thy praise
my offerings take , let this for me suffice
my heart a living pyramid i raise
ABAB
all are but parts of one stupendous whole
whose body nature is , and god the soul
that , changed through all , and yet in all the same
great in the earth as in th ’ ethereal frame
AABB
warms in the sun , refreshes in the breeze
glows in the stars and blossoms in the trees
lives through all life , extends through all extent
spreads undivided , operates unspent
AABB
breathes in our souls , informs our mortal part
as full , as perfect , in a hair as heart
as full , as perfect , in vile man that mourns
as the rapt seraph that adores and burns
AABB
what does the dim gaze of the dying find
to waken dream or memory , seeing you
in your sweet eyes what other eyes are blue
and in your hair what gold hair on the wind
ABBA
some lost love 's eyes are dim before they shine
with welcome : — so past homes , or homes to be
he sees a moment , ere , a moment blind
he crosses death 's inhospitable sea
ABAB
you think this cruel ? take it for a rule
no creature smarts so little as a fool
let peals of laughter , codrus ! round thee break
thou unconcern 'd canst hear the mighty crack
AABB
destroy his fib or sophistry , in vain
the creature 's at his dirty work again
thron 'd in the centre of his thin designs
proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines
AABB
the man for wisdom 's various arts renown 'd
long exercised in woes , o muse ! resound
who , when his arms had wrought the destined fall
of sacred troy , and razed her heaven built wall
AABB
wandering from clime to clime , observant stray 'd
their manners noted , and their states survey 'd
on stormy seas unnumber 'd toils he bore
safe with his friends to gain his natal shore
AABB
vain toils ! their impious folly dared to prey
on herds devoted to the god of day
the god vindictive doom 'd them never more
( ah , men unbless 'd !) to touch that natal shore
AABB
of all the causes which conspire to blind
man 's erring judgment , and misguide the mind
what the weak head with strongest bias rules
is pride , the never failing vice of fools
AABB
whatever nature has in worth denied
she gives in large recruits of needless pride
for as in bodies , thus in souls , we find
what wants in blood and spirits , swell 'd with wind
AABB
pride , where wit fails , steps in to our defence
and fills up all the mighty void of sense
if once right reason drives that cloud away
truth breaks upon us with resistless day
AABB
he sniffs the chilly air ; ( his dreaming starts
he 's riding in a dusty sussex lane
in quiet september ; slowly night departs
and he 's a living soul , absolved from pain
ABAB
beyond the brambled fences where he goes
are glimmering fields with harvest piled in sheaves
and tree tops dark against the stars grown pale
then , clear and shrill , a distant farm cock crows
ABBA
and there 's a wall of mist along the vale
where willows shake their watery sounding leaves
he gazes on it all , and scarce believes
that earth is telling its old peaceful tale
ABBA
lo as a careful huswife runs to catch
one of her feathered creatures broke away
sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay
ABAB
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
to follow that which flies before her face
not prizing her poor infant 's discontent
ABAB
so run'st thou after that which flies from thee
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
and play the mother 's part , kiss me , be kind
ABAB
“ long on the egyptian coast by calms confined
heaven to my fleet refused a prosperous wind
no vows had we preferr 'd , nor victims slain
for this the gods each favouring gale restrain
AABB
jealous , to see their high behests obey 'd
severe , if men the eternal rights evade
high o'er a gulfy sea , the pharian isle
fronts the deep roar of disemboguing nile
AABB
her distance from the shore , the course begun
at dawn , and ending with the setting sun
a galley measures ; when the stiffer gales
rise on the poop , and fully stretch the sails
AABB
‘ tis a cruel creed , believe it not
death to the good is a milder lot
they are here ,— they are here ,— that harmless pair
in the yellow sunshine and flowing air
AABB
in the light cloud shadows that slowly pass
in the sounds that rise from the murmuring grass
they sit where their humble cottage stood
they walk by the waving edge of the wood
AABB
and list to the long accustomed flow
of the brook that wets the rocks below
patient , and peaceful , and passionless
as seasons on seasons swiftly press
AABB
let us not to an unrestricted day
impediments admit . work is not work
to our employ é s , but a merry play
they do not ask the law 's excuse to shirk
ABAB
ah , no , the canning season is at hand
when summer scents are on the air distilled
when golden fruits are ripening in the land
and silvery tins are gaping to be filled
ABAB
now to the cannery with jocund mien
before the dawn come women , girls and boys
whose weekly hours ( a hundred and nineteen
seem all too short for their industrious joys
ABAB
thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now
before these bastard signs of fair were born
or durst inhabit on a living brow
ABAB
before the golden tresses of the dead
the right of sepulchres , were shorn away
to live a second life on second head
ere beauty 's dead fleece made another gay
ABAB
in him those holy antique hours are seen
without all ornament , it self and true
making no summer of another 's green
robbing no old to dress his beauty new
ABAB
what more miraculous thing may be told
that fire , which all things melts , should harden yse
and yse , which is congeald with sencelesse cold
should kindle fyre by wonderful devyse
ABAB
the whole world on a raft ! a duke is here
at sight of whose lank jaw the muses leer
journeyman printer , lamb with ferret eyes
in life 's skullduggery he takes the prize
AABB
yet stands at twilight wrapped in hamlet dreams
into his eyes the mississippi gleams
the sandbar sings in moonlit veils of foam
a candle shines from one lone cabin home
AABB
the waves reflect it like a drunken star
a banjo and a hymn are heard afar
no solace on the lazy shore excels
the duke 's blue castle with its steamer bells
AABB
dear are the forceful energies of song
for they do swell the spring tide of the heart
with rosier currents , and impel along
the life blood freely :— o ! they can impart
ABAB
raptures ne'er dreamt of by the sordid throng
who barter human feeling at the mart
of pamper 'd selfishness , and thus do wrong
imperial nature of her prime desert
ABAB
seward ! thy strains , beyond the critic praise
which may to arduous skill its meed assign
can the pure sympathies of spirit raise
to bright imagination 's throne divine
ABAB
two sister nymphs to ganges ’ flowery brink
230 bend their light steps , the lucid water drink
wind through the dewy rice , and nodding canes
( as eight black eunuchs guard the sacred plains
AABB
with playful malice watch the scaly brood
and shower the inebriate berries on the flood
235 stay in your crystal chambers , silver tribes
turn your bright eyes , and shun the dangerous bribes
AABB
when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead , and lovely knights
ABAB
then in the blazon of sweet beauty 's best
of hand , of foot , of lip , of eye , of brow
i see their antique pen would have expressed
even such a beauty as you master now
ABAB
thou radiant coachman , running endless course
fountain of heat , of light the lively source
life of the world , lamp of this universe
heaven 's richest gem : oh , teach me where my verse
AABB
may but begin thy praise : alas ! i fare
much like to one that in the clouds doth stare
to count the quails , that with their shadow cover
the italian sea , when soaring hither over
AABB
fain of a milder and more fruitful clime
they come with us to pass the summer time
no sooner he begins one shoal to sum
but , more and more , still greater shoals do come
AABB
but i have looked on pictures made by man
wherein , at first , appeared but chaos wild
so high the art transcended , it beguiled
the eye as formless , and without a plan
ABBA
and so i fear thy pictures were too strange
for us to pierce beyond their outmost look
a vapour and a darkness ; a sealed book
an atmosphere too high for wings to range
ABBA
the ladies named were wives of our gallants
so fond of contraband , and smuggled grants
who , vexed to be confined , still praised the dame
for skewing such address to ‘ scape from blame
AABB
she soon returned , and with her brought the fair
who , gaily singing , entered free from care
the painter them received with bow and kiss
to praise their beauty he was not remiss
AABB
their dress was charming ; all he much admired
their presence frolick , fun , and jest inspired
which no way pleased the husbands in the cage
who saw the freaks with marks of bursting rage
AABB
on many a saddened hearth the evening fire
burns paler as the children 's hour draws near
that joyous hour his song made doubly dear
and tender memories touch the faltering choir
ABBA
he sings no more on earth ; our vain desire
aches for the voice we loved so long to hear
in dorian flute notes breathing soft and clear
the sweet contralto that could never tire
ABBA
deafened with listening to a harsher strain
the maenad 's scream , the stark barbarian 's cry
still for those soothing , loving tones we sigh
oh , for our vanished orpheus once again
ABBA
far yonder , where orchards and gardens lie
and dwellings cluster , ‘ tis there men die
they are born , they die , and are buried near
where the populous grave yard lightens the bier
AABB
for strict and close are the ties that bind
in death the children of human kind
yea , stricter and closer than those of life
‘ tis a neighbourhood that knows no strife
AABB
they are noiselessly gathered — friend and foe
to the still and dark assemblies below
without a frown or a smile they meet
each pale and calm in his winding sheet
AABB
ah , well for him if here his suff'rings ceas 'd
and ample hours of rest his pains appeas 'd
but rous 'd again , and sternly bade to rise
and shake refreshing slumber from his eyes
AABB
ere his exhausted spirits can return
or through his frame reviving ardour burn
come forth he must , tho ’ limping , maim 'd , and sore
he hears the whip ; the chaise is at the door
AABB
the collar tightens , and again he feels
his half heal 'd wounds inflam 'd ; again the wheels
with tiresome sameness in his ears resound
o'er blinding dust , or miles of flinty ground
AABB
man 's heel is on the almighty 's neck who said
let there be hell , and there was hell — on earth
but not for that may men forget their worth
nay , but much more remember them — who led
ABBA
the living first from dwellings of the dead
and rent the cerecloths that were wont to engirth
souls wrapped and swathed and swaddled from their birth
with lies that bound them fast from heel to head
ABBA
among the tombs when wise men all their lives
dwelt , and cried out , and cut themselves with knives
these men , being foolish , and of saints abhorred
beheld in heaven the sun by saints reviled
AABB
who is it that says most , which can say more
than this rich praise , that you alone , are you
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew
ABAB
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory
but he that writes of you , if he can tell
that you are you , so dignifies his story
ABAB
let him but copy what in you is writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit
making his style admired every where
ABAB
another prospect pleased the builder 's eye
and fashion tenanted ( where fashion wanes
here in the sorrowful suburban lanes
when first these gables rose against the sky
ABBA
relic of a romantic taste gone by
this stately monument alone remains
vacant , with lichened walls and window panes
blank as the windows of a skull . but i
ABBA
on evenings when autumnal winds have stirred
in the porch vines , to this gray oracle
have laid a wondering ear and oft times heard
as from the hollow of a stranded shell
ABAB
i dream of you to wake : would that i might
dream of you and not wake but slumber on
nor find with dreams the dear companion gone
as summer ended summer birds take flight
ABBA
in happy dreams i hold you full in sight
i blush again who waking look so wan
brighter than sunniest day that ever shone
in happy dreams your smile makes day of night
ABBA
thus only in a dream we are at one
thus only in a dream we give and take
the faith that maketh rich who take or give
if thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake
ABAB
the lombard custom was , that when the king
who slept not with his queen , ( a common thing
in other countries too ) , desired to greet
his royal consort , and in bed to meet
AABB
a night gown solely o'er his back he threw
and then proceeded to the interview
knocked softly at the door , on which a fair
who waited on the queen with anxious care
AABB
allowed the prince to enter ; took his light
( which only glimmered in the midst of night
then put it out , and quickly left the room
a little lantern to dispel the gloom
AABB
yes ! let the rich deride , the proud disdain
these simple blessings of the lowly train
to me more dear , congenial to my heart
one native charm , than all the gloss of art
AABB
spontaneous joys , where nature has its play
the soul adopts , and owns their first born sway
lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind
unenvied , unmolested , unconfined
AABB
but the long pomp , the midnight masquerade
with all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed
in these , ere triflers half their wish obtain
the toiling pleasure sickens into pain
AABB
unchanged within , to see all changed without
is a blank lot and hard to bear , no doubt
yet why at others ’ wanings should'st thou fret
then only might'st thou feel a just regret
AABB
hadst thou withheld thy love or hid thy light
in selfish forethought of neglect and slight
o wiselier then , from feeble yearnings freed
while , and on whom , thou may'st — shine on ! nor heed
AABB
whether the object by reflected light
return thy radiance or absorb it quite
and though thou notest from thy safe recess
old friends burn dim , like lamps in noisome air
AABB
some truths there be are better left unsaid
much is there that we may not speak unblamed
on words , as wings , how many joys have fled
the jealous fairies love not to be named
ABAB
there is an old world tale of one whose bed
a genius graced , to all , save him , unknown
one day the secret passed his lips , and sped
as secrets speed — thenceforth he slept alone
ABAB
too much , oh ! far too much is told in books
too broad a daylight wraps us all and each
ah ! it is well that , deeper than our looks
some secrets lie beyond conjecture 's reach
ABAB
say thou , his will be done who is the good
his will be borne who knoweth how to bear
who also in the night had need of prayer
both when awoke divinely longing mood
ABBA
and when the power of darkness him withstood
for what is coming take no jot of care
behind , before , around thee as the air
he o'er thee like thy mother 's heart will brood
ABBA
and when thou hast wearied thy wings of prayer
then fold them , and drop gently to thy nest
which is thy faith ; and make thy people blest
with what thou bring'st from that ethereal height
ABBA
how long shall i in mine affliction mourn
a burden to myself , distressed in mind
when shall my interdicted hopes return
from out despair wherein they live confined
ABAB
when shall her troubled brow charged with disdain
reveal the treasure which her smiles impart
when shall my faith the happiness attain
to break the ice that hath congealed her heart
ABAB
son of the lightning and the light that glows
beyond the lightning 's or the morning 's light
soul splendid with all righteous love of right
in whose keen fire all hopes and fears and woes
ABBA
were clean consumed , and from their ashes rose
transfigured , and intolerable to sight
save of purged eyes whose lids had cast off night
in love 's and wisdom 's likeness when they close
ABBA
embracing , and between them truth stands fast
embraced of either ; thou whose feet were set
on english earth while this was england yet
our friend that art , our sidney 's friend that wast
ABBA
the king gazed upward at the cloudless sky
whispered a word , and raised his hand on high
and lo ! the signet ring of chrysoprase
on his uplifted finger seemed to blaze
AABB
with hidden fire , and rushing from the west
there came a mighty wind , and seized the guest
and lifted him from earth , and on they passed
his shining garments streaming in the blast
AABB
go down to hell . this end is good to see
the breath is lightened and the sense at ease
because thou art not ; sense nor breath there is
in what thy body was , whose soul shall be
ABBA
chief nerve of hell 's pained heart eternally
thou art abolished from the midst of these
that are what thou wast : pius from his knees
blows off the dust that flecked them , bowed for thee
ABBA
yea , now the long tongued slack lipped litanies
fail , and the priest has no more prayer to sell
now the last jesuit found about thee is
the beast that made thy fouler flesh his cell
ABAB
where fortless falmouth , looking o'er her bay
in terror saw the approaching thunders play
the fire begins ; the shells o'er arching fly
and shoot a thousand rainbows thro the sky
AABB
on charlestown spires , on bedford roofs they light
groton and fairfield kindle from the flight
norwalk expands the blaze ; o'er reading hills
high flaming danbury the welkin fills
AABB
esopus burns , newyork 's delightful fanes
and sea nursed norfolk light the neighboring plains
from realm to realm the smoky volumes bend
reach round the bays and up the streams extend
AABB
with the same heart , i said , i 'll answer thee
as those , when thou shalt call me by my name
lo , the vain promise ! is the same , the same
perplexed and ruffled by life 's strategy
ABBA
when called before , i told how hastily
i dropped my flowers or brake off from a game
to run and answer with the smile that came
at play last moment , and went on with me
ABBA
through my obedience . when i answer now
i drop a grave thought , break from solitude
yet still my heart goes to thee — ponder how
not as to a single good , but all my good
ABAB
the face of all the world is changed , i think
since first i heard the footsteps of thy soul
move still , oh , still , beside me , as they stole
betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink
ABBA
of obvious death , where i , who thought to sink
was caught up into love , and taught the whole
of life in a new rhythm . the cup of dole
god gave for baptism , i am fain to drink
ABBA
‘ neath myriad mellow tapers ’ golden glow
a woman stands , proud , insolent and fair
a single gem meshed in the dusk dyed hair
burns like the evening star descending low
ABBA
adown the dark'ning sky . upon the snow
of her full blossomed breast deep rubies lie
her fragrant presence breathes sweet sorcery
the shimmering saffron satin 's flexile flow
ABBA
outlines each sinuous curve ; a sensuous smile
a touch that fires to flame each pulsant vein
one draught of eyes more deep than depths of wine
the senses steal , the soul and brain beguile
ABBA
who lives enthralled to cupid and his flame
from day to day is changed in sundry sort
the proof whereof myself may well report
who oft transformed by him may teach the same
ABBA
i first was turned into a wounded hart
that bare the bloody arrow in my side
then to a swan that midst the waters glide
with piteous voice presaged my deadly smart
ABBA
eftsoons i waxed a faint and fading flower
then was i made a fountain sudden dry
distilling all my tears from troubled eye
now am i salamander by his power
ABBA
minds strong by fits , irregularly great
that flash and darken like revolving lights
catch more the vulgar eye unschooled to wait
on the long curve of patient days and nights
ABAB
bounding a whole life to the circle fair
of orbed fulfilment ; and this balanced soul
so simple in its grandeur , coldly bare
of draperies theatric , standing there
AABB
in perfect symmetry of self control
seems not so great at first , but greater grows
still as we look , and by experience learn
how grand this quiet is , how nobly stern
AABB
beyond the seas we know stretch seas unknown
blue and bright colored for our dim and green
beyond the lands we see , stretch lands unseen
with many tinted tangle overgrown
ABBA
and icebound seas there are like seas of stone
serenely stormless as death lies serene
and lifeless tracks of sand , which intervene
betwixt the lands where living flowers are blown
ABBA
this dead and living world befits our case
who live and die : we live in wearied hope
we die in hope not dead ; we run a race
to day , and find no present halting place
AABB
but ah , those leaves !— it was not summer 's mouth
breathed such a gold upon them . and look there
that beech how red ! see , through its boughs , half bare
how low the sun lies in the mid day south
ABBA
the sweetness is but one pined memory flown
back from our summer , wandering alone
see , see the dead leaves falling ! hear thy heart
which , with the year 's pulse beating swift or slow
AABB
takes in the changing world its changing part
return a sigh , an echo sad and low
to the faint , scarcely audible sound
with which the leaf goes whispering to the ground
AABB
the partial papists would infer from hence
their church , in last resort , should judge the sense
but first they would assume , with wondrous art
themselves to be the whole , who are but part
AABB
of that vast frame the church ; yet grant they were
the handers down , can they from thence infer
a right to interpret ? or would they alone
who brought the present , claim it for their own
AABB
the book 's a common largess to mankind
not more for them than every man design 'd
the welcome news is in the letter found
the carrier 's not commissioned to expound
AABB
two crowned kings , and one that stood alone
with no green weight of laurels round his head
but with sad eyes as one uncomforted
and wearied with man 's never ceasing moan
ABBA
for sins no bleating victim can atone
and sweet long lips with tears and kisses fed
girt was he in a garment black and red
and at his feet i marked a broken stone
ABBA
which sent up lilies , dove like , to his knees
now at their sight , my heart being lit with flame
i cried to beatrice , ‘ who are these
and she made answer , knowing well each name
ABAB
she , by her neighbour , was received , we 're told
‘ mid costly furniture and burnished gold
we may suppose what splendour shone around
when all attracting he would fain be found
AABB
the best of wines ; each dish considered rare
the gods themselves received not better fare
till then , alaciel ne'er had tasted wine
her faith forbade a liquor so divine
AABB
and , unacquainted with the potent juice
she much indulged at table in its use
if lately love disquieted her brain
new poison now pervaded ev'ry vein
AABB
so speaking ceas 'd awhile the enraptur 'd knight
for now the two fair damsels met his sight
each on her arm resplendent vestments brought
fresh from the loom , magnificently wrought
AABB
enrob 'd in them , with added grace he mov 'd
as one by nature form 'd to be belov 'd
and , by the fairy to the banquet led
and placed beside her on one genial bed
AABB
whiles the twain handmaids every want supplied
cates were his fare to mortal man denied
yet was there one , the foremost of the feast
one food there was far sweeter than the rest
AABB
the turkey , well seasoned , and tenderly browned
is flanked by the spiciest a la mode “ round
the great “ priestly ham , ” in its juiciest pride
is there ,— with the tenderest surloin beside
AABB
neat bottles , suggestive of ketchups and wines
and condiments racy , of various kinds
and firm rolls of butter as yellow as gold
and patties and biscuit most rare to behold
AABB
and sauces that richest of odors betray
are marshalled in most appetizing array
then beverly brings of his nuts a full store
and archie has apples , a dozen or more
AABB
and so they buried lincoln ? strange and vain
has any creature thought of lincoln hid
in any vault ‘ neath any coffin lid
in all the years since that wild spring of pain
ABBA
‘ tis false — he never in the grave hath lain
you could not bury him although you slid
upon his clay the cheops pyramid
or heaped it with the rocky mountain chain
ABBA
they slew themselves ;— they but set lincoln free
in all the earth his great heart beats as strong
shall beat while pulses throb to chivalry
and burn with hate of tyranny and wrong
ABAB
of old i wandered by the river 's side
between whose banks the mighty waters glide
where vast niagara , hurrying to its fall
builds and unbuilds its ever tumbling wall
AABB
oft in my dreams i hear the rush and roar
of battling floods , and feel the trembling shore
as the huge torrent , girded for its leap
with bellowing thunders plunges down the steep
AABB
not less distinct , from memory 's pictured urn
the gray old rock , the leafy woods , return
robed in their pride the lofty oaks appear
and once again with quickened sense i hear
AABB
next rattling dice invite th ’ attentive ear
lords loudly laugh , as loud the bullies swear
the country knight o'th ’ shire sells his estate
and here with heart intrepid meets his fate
AABB
so they withdrew to quench their glowing flame
and to preserve the honour of her name
for oh ! sad fate as they ascend the stairs
at the room door her good mamma appears
AABB
soon as she spies her child with looks demure
she charges her to keep her vessel pure
miss pertly answers to avoid her doom
mamma , whose hat and wig is in the room
AABB
the wise world saith i not unlock 'd my heart
when i of thee and thy dear love did write
and would each word of mine to false convert
doing my simple sense a double spite
ABAB
it saith thou wert but shadow born of nought
but vain creation of an apish rhyme
while , fashion 's fool , my strain 'd invention sought
to better them who best did please the time
ABAB
but wherefore say they so , and do dear wrong
to thee , whose worth was my sole argument
to me , whose verse ‘ twas truth alone made strong
by that the breast must feel , not brain invent
ABAB
road by which all might come and go that would
and bear out freights of worth to foreign lands
that this most famous stream in bogs and sands
should perish ; and to evil and to good
ABBA
be lost for ever . in our halls is hung
armoury of the invincible knights of old
we must be free or die , who speak the tongue
that shakespeare spake ; the faith and morals hold
ABAB
enrapt , the queen gazed on her glorious self
then trembling with the thrill of sudden thought
commanded that the skilful wight be brought
that she might dower him with lands and pelf
ABBA
then out upon the silent sea lapt shelf
and up the hills and on the downs they sought
him who so well and wondrously had wrought
and with much search found and brought home the elf
ABBA
but he put by all gifts with sad replies
and from his lips these words flowed forth like wine
“ o queen , i want no gift but thee , ” he said
she heard and looked on him with love lit eyes
ABBA
captain sword , like a witless thing
of all under heaven must needs be king
king of kings , and lord of lords
swayer of souls as well as of swords
AABB
ruler of speech , and through speech , of thought
and hence to his brain was a madness brought
he madden 'd in east , he madden 'd in west
fiercer for sights of men 's unrest
AABB
fiercer for talk , amongst awful men
of their new mighty leader , captain pen
a conqueror strange , who sat in his home
like the wizard that plagued the ships of rome
AABB
it one day happened , that this forward spark
the girl we speak of , met within the park
and to a summer house the fav'rite drew
the course they took the princess chanced to view
AABB
as wand'ring near ; but neither swain nor fair
suspicion had , that any one was there
and this gallant most confidently thought
the girl by force , might to his terms be brought
AABB
his wretched temper , obstacle to love
and ev'ry bliss bestowed by heav'n above
had oft his hopes of favours lately marred
and fear , with those designs , had also jarred
AABB
and zeno paled , but joss with laugh exclaimed
“ why , all these good black men so grandly named
are only nests for mice . by jove , although
they lifelike look and terrible , we know
AABB
alas ! the end 's not pleasant — puts one out
to have been kings and dukes — made mighty rout
colossal heroes filling tombs with slain
and , madame , this to only now remain
AABB
a modern hour from london ( as we spin
into a silver thread the miles of space
between us and our goal ) , there is a place
apart from city traffic , dust , and din
ABBA
green with great trees , where hides a quiet inn
here nelson last looked on the lovely face
which made his world ; and by its magic grace
trailed rosy clouds across each early sin
ABBA
and , leaning lawnward , is the room where keats
wrote the last one of those immortal songs
( called by the critics of his day ‘ mere rhymes
a lark , high in the boxwood bough repeats
ABBA
by holy motives led , and not chagrin
the hermit never spoke of what he 'd seen
but , from the youth 's discernment , strove to hide
whate'er regarded love , and much beside
AABB
the softer sex , with all their magick charms
that fill the feeling bosom with alarms
as years advanced , the boy with care he taught
what suited best his age before him brought
AABB
at five he showed him animals and flow'rs
the birds of air , the beasts , their sev'ral pow'rs
and now and then of hell he gave a hint
old satan 's wrath , and what might awe imprint
AABB
o king , whose greatness none can comprehend
whose boundless goodness doth to all extend
light of all beauty ! ocean without ground
that standing flowest , giving dost abound
AABB
rich palace , and indweller ever blest
never not working , ever yet in rest
what wit cannot conceive , words say of thee
here , where , as in a mirror , we but see
AABB
shadows of shadows , atoms of thy might
still owly eyed while staring on thy light
grant that , released from this earthly jail
and freed of clouds which here our knowledge veil
AABB
what artful hand the wretch 's form can hit
begot by satan on a m —— ly 's wit
in parties furious at the great man 's nod
and hating none for nothing , but his god
AABB
foe to the learn 'd , the virtuous , and the sage
a pimp in youth , an atheist in old age
now plung 'd in bawdry and substantial lyes
now dab'ling in ungodly theories
AABB
but so , as swallows skim the pleasing flood
grows giddy , but ne'er drinks to do him good
alike resolv 'd to flatter , or to cheat
nay worship onions , if they cry , come eat
AABB
so went our boys when edward sixth , the king
chartered christ 's hospital , and died . and so
full fifteen generations in a string
of heirs to his bequest have had to go
ABAB
thus camden showed , and barnes , and stilling fleet
and richardson , that bade our lovelace be
the little elia thus in newgate street
thus to his genevieve young s. t. c
ABAB
with thousands else that , wandering up and down
quaint , privileged , liked and reputed well
made the great school a part of london town
patent as paul 's and vital as bow bell
ABAB
an ill march noon ; the flagstones gray with dust
an all round east wind volleying straws and grit
st. martin 's steps , where every venomous gust
lingers to buffet , or sneap , the passing cit
ABAB
the drunkard 's mouth a wash for something drinkable
the drunkard 's eye alert for casual toppers
the drunkard 's neck stooped to a lot scarce thinkable
a living , crawling blazoning of hot coppers
ABAB
who 'll , know it ? richard earnestly replied
in jack 's concealment we may both confide
excuse the trick i 've played and ne'er repine
address , force , treachery , in love combine
AABB
all are permitted when intrigue ‘ s the word
to hold the contrary were quite absurd
till stratagem was used i naught could gain
but looks and darts from eyes , for all my pain
AABB
i 've paid myself ;— would you have done it ?— no
‘ tis all as might be wished ;— come , smiles bestow
i 'm satisfied , the fault was not with you
in this , to make you wretched , naught i view
AABB
it may indeed be phantasy , when i
essay to draw from all created things
deep , heartfelt , inward joy that closely clings
and trace in leaves and flowers that round me lie
ABBA
lessons of love and earnest piety
so let it be ; and if the wide world rings
in mock of this belief , it brings
nor fear , nor grief , nor vain perplexity
ABBA
so will i build my altar in the fields
and the blue sky my fretted dome shall be
and the sweet fragrance that the wild flower yields
shall be the incense i will yield to thee
ABAB
the sire return 'd : my great desire you know
to shield from slaughter and preserve the foe
in bands of concord all their tribes to bind
and live the friend and guardian of mankind
AABB
should strife begin , thy youthful arm shall share
the toils of glory thro the walks of war
but o'er their hills to seek alone the foes
to gain their confidence or brave their blows
AABB
bend their proud souls to reason 's voice divine
claims hardier limbs and riper years than thine
yet one of heavenly race the task requires
whose mystic rites control the solar fires
AABB
of old i wandered by the river 's side
between whose banks the mighty waters glide
where vast niagara , hurrying to its fall
builds and unbuilds its ever tumbling wall
AABB
oft in my dreams i hear the rush and roar
of battling floods , and feel the trembling shore
as the huge torrent , girded for its leap
with bellowing thunders plunges down the steep
AABB
not less distinct , from memory 's pictured urn
the gray old rock , the leafy woods , return
robed in their pride the lofty oaks appear
and once again with quickened sense i hear
AABB
towardes yow , how ever that i fare
to goon a begged in my kirtle bare
but wolde ye vouche sauf , up on seurtee
two yeer or three for to respyten me
AABB
i would not if i could undo my past
tho ’ for its sake my future is a blank
my past for which i have myself to thank
for all its faults and follies first and last
ABBA
i would not cast anew the lot once cast
or launch a second ship for one that sank
or drug with sweets the bitterness i drank
or break by feasting my perpetual fast
ABBA
oh , think not i am faithful to a vow
faithless am i save to love 's self alone
were you not lovely i would leave you now
after the feet of beauty fly my own
ABAB
were you not still my hunger 's rarest food
and water ever to my wildest thirst
i would desert you — think not but i would
and seek another as i sought you first
ABAB
but you are mobile as the veering air
and all your charms more changeful than the tide
wherefore to be inconstant is no care
i have but to continue at your side
ABAB
i thank you , kind and best belov ë d friend
with the same thanks one murmurs to a sister
when , for some gentle favor , he hath kissed her
less for the gifts than for the love you send
ABBA
less for the flowers than what the flowers convey
if i , indeed , divine their meaning truly
and not unto myself ascribe , unduly
things which you neither meant nor wished to say
ABBA
oh ! tell me , is the hope then all misplaced
and am i flattered by my own affection
but in your beauteous gift , methought i traced
something above a short lived predilection
ABAB
run , shepherds , run where bethlehem blest appears
we bring the best of news ; be not dismayed
a saviour there is born more old than years
amidst heaven 's rolling height this earth who stayed
ABAB
in a poor cottage inned , a virgin maid
a weakling did him bear , who all upbears
there is he poorly swaddled , in manger laid
to whom too narrow swaddlings are our spheres
ABAB
run , shepherds , run , and solemnize his birth
this is that night — no , day , grown great with bliss
in which the power of satan broken is
in heaven be glory , peace unto the earth
ABBA
i said : old earth has put away her snows
all living things make merry to their bent
a flower is come for every flower that went
in autumn ; the sun glows , the south wind blows
ABBA
so walking in a garden of delight
i came upon one sheltered shadowed nook
where broad leaf shadows veiled the day with night
and there lay snow unmelted by the sun
ABAB
but soon the morn , on many a distant height
fingers the raven locks of lingering night
the last dark shadows that precede the day
have stripped the splendour from the milky way
AABB
and nature seems disturbed by fitful dreams
as one who shudders when the owlet screams
the painful burden of the whippoorwill
like a vague sorrow , floats from hill to hill
AABB
along the vales the doleful accents run
where the white vapours dread the burning sun
while human voices stir the haunted air
one sings “ the plough , ” another warbles “ claire
AABB
what were i , love , if i were stripped of thee
if thine eyes shut me out whereby i live
thou , who unto my calmer soul dost give
knowledge , and truth , and holy mystery
ABBA
wherein truth mainly lies for those who see
beyond the earthly and the fugitive
who in the grandeur of the soul believe
and only in the infinite are free
ABBA
without thee i were naked , bleak , and bare
as yon dead cedar on the sea cliff 's brow
and nature 's teachings , which come to me now
common and beautiful as light and air
ABBA
yet all its varied charms , forever free
from task and tribute , labor yields to thee
no more , when april sheds her fitful rain
the sower 's hand shall cast its flying grain
AABB
no more , when autumn strews the flaming leaves
the reaper 's band shall gird its yellow sheaves
for thee alike the circling seasons flow
till the first blossoms heave the latest snow
AABB
in the stiff clod below the whirling drifts
in the loose soil the springing herbage lifts
in the hot dust beneath the parching weeds
life 's withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds
AABB
and you , mine eyes , the agents of my heart
told the dumb message of my hidden grief
and oft , with careful tunes , with silent art
did treat the cruel fair to yield relief
ABAB
and you , my verse , the advocates of love
have followed hard the process of my case
and urged that title which doth plainly prove
my faith should win , if justice might have place
ABAB
none other fame mine unambitious muse
affected ever but t'eternise thee
all other honours do my hopes refuse
which meaner prized and momentary be
ABAB
for god forbid i should my papers blot
with mercenary lines with servile pen
praising virtues in them that have them not
basely attending on the hopes of men
ABAB
it is not with a hope my feeble praise
can add one moment 's honor to thy own
that with thy mighty name i grace these lays
i seek to glorify myself alone
ABAB
for that some precious favor thou hast shown
to my endeavor in a bygone time
and by this token i would have it known
thou art my friend , and friendly to my rhyme
ABAB
it is my dear ambition now to climb
still higher in thy thought ,— if my bold pen
may thrust on contemplations more sublime
but i am thirsty for thy praise , for when
ABAB
nat started the bowling ( and take my word , misters
there 's no bowling like it for underhand twisters
and what with the pace and the screw and the aim
it was pretty hard work , was that blunderby game
AABB
with nat in the field to look after the ball
‘ twas a terrible struggle to get runs at all
though they hit out their hardest a regular stunner
‘ twas rare that it reckoned for more than a oner
AABB
since there is no escape , since at the end
my body will be utterly destroyed
this hand i love as i have loved a friend
this body i tended , wept with and enjoyed
ABAB
since there is no escape even for me
who love life with a love too sharp to bear
the scent of orchards in the rain , the sea
and hours alone too still and sure for prayer
ABAB
since darkness waits for me , then all the more
let me go down as waves sweep to the shore
in pride ; and let me sing with my last breath
in these few hours of light i lift my head
AABB
how yesterday is long ago ! the past
is a fixed infinite distance from to day
and bygone things , the first lived as the last
in irreparable sameness far away
ABAB
this thing time is , whose being is having none
the equable tyrant of our different fates
who could not be bought off by a shattered sun
or tricked by new use of our careful dates
ABAB
that being now with her huge brightnesse dazed
base thing i can no more endure to view
but , looking still on her , i stand amazed
at wondrous sight of so celestiall hew
ABAB
so when my toung would speak her praises dew
it stopped is with thoughts astonishment
and when my pen would write her titles true
it ravisht is with fancies wonderment
ABAB
‘ tis vastly fine , of course ; if fate would smile
i fancy that the cloud compeller 's style
would suit me sweetly ; just the line i love
resolute rule 's the appanage of a jove
AABB
but shelley 's dismal demogorgon 's self
that solemn , shadowy , stern , oracular elf
plus obstinate prometheus , did not play
such mischief as the parties do to day
AABB
no glory makes me glorious or glad
nor pleasure may to pleasure me dispose
no comfort can revive my senses sad
nor hope enfranchise me with one repose
ABAB
nor in her absence taste i one delight
nor in her presence am i well content
was never time gave term to my despite
nor joy that dried the tears of my lament
ABAB
nor hold i hope of weal in memory
nor have i thought to change my restless grief
nor doth my conquest yield me sovereignty
nor hope repose , nor confidence relief
ABAB
the muses fairest light in no dark time
the wonder of a learned age ; the line
that none can pass : the most proportion 'd wit
to nature ; the best judge of what was fit
AABB
the deepest , plainest , highest , clearest pen
the voyce most eccho 'd by consenting men
the soul which answer 'd best to all well said
by others ; and which most requital made
AABB
tun 'd to the highest key of ancient rome
returning all her musick with her own
in whom with nature , study claim 'd a part
and yet who to himself ow 'd all his art
AABB
and why shou 'd not a man adore his wife
since she 's the only comfort of his life
a gift presented by the gods above
a lively emblem of the charms of love
AABB
all o 're divine , a heaven , here below
man 's paradice , where joys in plenty flow
no shame , but honour does bless 'd wedlock crown
and ushers in both glory and renown
AABB
sweet pretty babes , the product of each charm
in marriage bed protects us from all harm
their innocence like lambs and doves appear
which make our hearts and minds quite void of care
AABB
when simple macer , now of high renown
first sought a poet 's fortune in the town
‘ twas all the ambition his high soul could feel
to wear red stockings , and to dine with steele
AABB
some ends of verse his betters might afford
and gave the harmless fellow a good word
set up with these , he ventured on the town
and with a borrow 'd play , out did poor crowne
AABB
there he stopp 'd short , nor since has writ a tittle
but has the wit to make the most of little
like stunted , hide bound trees that just have got
sufficient sap at once to bear and rot
AABB
“ lords my barons , ” the emperor said
“ king marsil to me hath his envoys sped
he proffers treasure surpassing bounds
bears and lions , and leash è d hounds
AABB
seven hundred camels that bend the knee
a thousand hawks that have moulted free
four hundred mules with arab gold
which fifty wains might scantly hold
AABB
but he saith to france must i wend my way
he will follow to aix with brief delay
bend his heart unto christ 's belief
and hold his marches of me in fief
AABB
i hate the common road of praise
or what the gaping vulgar raise
which with a pleasant gale a while
fame hurries , but doth soone beguile
AABB
a private fame , a meane house , where
i live conceal ’ d from popular ayre
best fits my mind , and shelters me
vertue t ’ her owne praise deafe should be
AABB
on high hills top i saw a stately frame
an hundred cubits high by iust assize
with hundreth pillours fronting faire the same
all wrought with diamond after dorick wize
ABAB
nor brick nor marble was the wall in view
but shining christall , which from top to base
out of her womb a thousand rayons ** threw
on hundred steps of afrike golds enchase
ABAB
golde was the parget ,$ and the seeling bright
did shine all scaly with great plates of golde
the floore of iasp and emeraude was dight
o worlds vainesse ! whiles thus i did behold
ABAB
there was a youth around whose early way
white angels hung in converse and sweet choir
teaching in summer clouds his thought to stray
in cloud and far horizon to desire
ABAB
his life was nursed in beauty , like the stream
born of clear showers and the mountain dew
close under snow clad summits where they gleam
forever pure against heaven 's orient blue
ABAB
within the city 's shades he walked at last
faint and more faint in sad recessional
down the dim corridors of time outworn
a chorus ebbed from that forsaken past
ABBA
a link boy once , dick hellfinch stood the grin
at charing cross he long his toil apply 'd
“ here light , here light ! your honours for a win
to every cull and drab he loudly cried
ABAB
in leicester fields , as most the story know
“ come black your worship for a single mag
and while he shin 'd his nelly suck 'd the bag
and thus they sometimes stagg 'd a precious go
ABBA
in smithfield , too , where graziers ’ flats resort
he loiter 'd there to take in men of cash
with cards and dice was up to ev'ry sport
and at saltpetre bank would cut a dash
ABAB
and weep not , though the beautiful decay
within thy heart , as daily in thine eyes
thy heart must have its autumn , its pale skies
leading , mayhap , to winter 's dim dismay
ABBA
yet doubt not . beauty doth not pass away
her form departs not , though her body dies
secure beneath the earth the snowdrop lies
waiting the spring 's young resurrection day
ABBA
through the kind nurture of the winter cold
nor seek thou by vain effort to revive
the summer time , when roses were alive
do thou thy work — be willing to be old
ABBA
who doth desire that chaste his wife should be
first be he true , for truth doth truth deserve
then such be he as she his worth may see
and one man still credit with her preserve
ABAB
not toying kind , nor causelessly unkind
not stirring thoughts , nor yet denying right
not spying faults , nor in plain errors blind
never hard hand , nor ever reins too light
ABAB
as far from want , as far from vain expense
( the one doth force , the latter doth entice
allow good company , but keep from thence
all filthy mouths that glory in their vice
ABAB
then from the depths , in bitterness she cried
‘ hell is on earth , and heaven is but a dream
and human life a troubled aimless stream
and god is nowhere . would god so deride
ABBA
a loving creature 's faith ? ’ a voice replied
‘ the stream flows onward to the source supreme
where things that are replace the things that seem
and where the deeds of all past lives abide
ABBA
once at thy door love languished and was spurned
who sorrow plants , must garner sorrow 's sheaf
no prayers can change the seedling in the sod
by thine own heart love 's anguish must be learned
ABBA
was it the proud full sail of his great verse
bound for the prize of ( all too precious ) you
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
ABAB
was it his spirit , by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch , that struck me dead
no , neither he , nor his compeers by night
giving him aid , my verse astonished
ABAB
he nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
as victors of my silence cannot boast
i was not sick of any fear from thence
ABAB
this is my play 's last scene ; here heavens appoint
my pilgrimage 's last mile ; and my race
idly yet quickly run , hath this last pace
my span 's last inch , my minute 's latest point
ABBA
and gluttonous death will instantly unjoint
my body and soul , and i shall sleep a space
but my ever waking part shall see that face
whose fear already shakes my every joint
ABBA
then as my soul to heaven , her first seat , takes flight
and earth born body in the earth shall dwell
so fall my sins , that all may have their right
to where they 're bred , and would press me to hell
ABAB
my spotless love hovers with purest wings
about the temple of the proudest frame
where blaze those lights , fairest of earthly things
which clear our clouded world with brightest flame
ABAB
m'ambitious thoughts , confin è d in her face
affect no honour but what she can give
my hopes do rest in limits of her grace
i weigh no comfort unless she relieve
ABAB
how thick the clouds of night are rang 'd o'er head
confounding darkness o'er the earth is spread
the clouded moon her cheering count'nance hides
and feeble stars , between the ragged sides
AABB
of broken clouds , with unavailing ray
look thro ’ to mock the trav'ller on his way
tree , bush , and rugged rock , and hollow dell
in deeper shades their forms confus'dly tell
AABB
to cheat the weary wand'rer ' s doubtful eye
whilst chilly passing winds come ruffling by
and tangled briars perplex the darken 'd pass
and slimy reptiles glimmer on the grass
AABB
love , loyallest and lordliest born of things
immortal that shouldst be , though all else end
in plighted hearts of fearless friend with friend
whose hand may curb or clip thy plume plucked wings
ABBA
not grief 's nor time 's : though these be lords and kings
crowned , and their yoke bid vassal passions bend
they may not pierce the spirit of sense , or blend
quick poison with the soul 's live watersprings
ABBA
the true clear heart whose core is manful trust
fears not that very death may turn to dust
love lit therein as toward a brother born
if one touch make not all its fine gold rust
AABB
— “ and where is my cat ? ” a vixen squalled
“ yes , where are our cats ? ” the witches bawled
and began to call them all by name
as fast as they called the cats , they came
AABB
there was bob tailed tommy and long tailed tim
and wall eyed jacky and green eyed jim
and splay foot benny and slim legged beau
and skinny and squally , and jerry and joe
AABB
and many another that came at call
it would take too long to count them all
all black ,— one could hardly tell which was which
but every cat knew his own old witch
AABB
from these digressions upon love and glory
‘ tis time we were returning to our story
i only meant , in a few words , to tell you
( for fear my heroine 's conduct should repel you
AABB
that if she jests , for instance , out of season
perhaps there is a good substantial reason
sir gawayne , had he seen the stranger wink
and seen the lady blushing , you may think
AABB
might have been spared a most unhappy lot
perhaps you 're right ;— but peradventure not
i give you but a hint , for half the art
of narrative is holding back a part
AABB
kindness gave solitude the lovely light
she loved , and made less terrible black midnight
even as a bird its unlearned music pours
though windows all be blind and shut the doors
AABB
and sings on still though no faint sound be heard
but wind and leaves and another lonely bird
so poured she untaught kindness all around
and in that human music comfort found
AABB
music her own and music heard from others
prime music of all lovers , children , mothers
precarious music between all men sounding
the horror of silent and dark powers confounding
AABB
the dead and dying in his pathway lie
before him ranks divide and squadrons fly
with stalwart arm , and with unerring aim
he adds new glories to his former fame
AABB
reaps the reward of all his toil : for now
fresh laurels twine around his youthful brow
but what avail they ? for the fatal dart
of death has lodged within that hoping heart
AABB
the lofty head that wore the waving crest
now sadly droops upon the bleeding breast
that mighty arm , upraised in power and pride
falls feebly down , and casts its sword aside
AABB
the other meets me in the public throng
her hair streams backward from her loose attire
she hath a trumpet and an eye of fire
she points me downward , steadily and long
ABBA
“ there is thy grave — arise , my son , be strong
hands are upon thy crown — awake , aspire
to immortality ; heed not the lyre
of the enchantress , nor her poppy song
ABBA
but in the stillness of the summer calm
tremble for what is godlike in thy being
listen a while , and thou shall hear the psalm
of victory sung by creatures past thy seeing
ABAB
thus he who shakes olympus with his nod
then gave to paeon ’ s care the bleeding god
with gentle hand the balm he pour ’ d around
and heal ’ d the immortal flesh , and closed the wound
AABB
as when the fig ’ s press ’ d juice , infused in cream
to curds coagulates the liquid stream
sudden the fluids fix the parts combined
such , and so soon , the ethereal texture join ’ d
AABB
cleansed from the dust and gore , fair hebe dress ’ d
his mighty limbs in an immortal vest
glorious he sat , in majesty restored
fast by the throne of heaven ’ s superior lord
AABB
the shelves are full , all other themes are sped
hackneyed and worn to the last flimsy thread
satire has long since done his best , and curst
and loathsome ribaldry has done his worst
AABB
fancy has sported all her powers away
in tales , in trifles , and in children 's play
and ‘ tis the sad complaint , and almost true
whate'er we write , we bring forth nothing new
AABB
‘ twere new indeed to see a bard all fire
touched with a coal from heaven , assume the lyre
and tell the world , still kindling as he sung
with more than mortal music on his tongue
AABB
arion , when , through tempests cruel wracke
he forth was thrown into the greedy seas
through the sweet musick which his harp did make
allur 'd a dolphin him from death to ease
ABAB
but my rude musick , which was wont to please
some dainty eares , cannot , with any skill
the dreadfull tempest of her wrath appease
nor move the dolphin from her stubborn will
ABAB
but in her pride she dooth persever still
all carelesse how my life for her decayes
yet with one word she can it save or spill
to spill were pitty , but to save were prayse
ABAB
milton ! thou shouldst be living at this hour
england hath need of thee ; she is a fen
of stagnant waters : altar , sword , and pen
fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower
ABBA
have forfeited their ancient english dower
of inward happiness . we are selfish men
oh ! raise us up , return to us again
and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power
ABBA
thy soul was like a star , and dwelt apart
thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea
pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free
so didst thou travel on life 's common way
ABBA
great god whom i shall carve from this gray stone
wherein thou liest , hid to all but me
grant thou that when my art hath made thee known
and others bow , i shall not worship thee
ABAB
but , as i pray thee now , then let me pray
some greater god , — like thee to be conceived
within my soul , — for strength to turn away
from his new altar , when , that task achieved
ABAB
he , too , stands manifest . yea , let me yearn
from dream to grander dream ! let me not rest
content at any goal ! still bid me spurn
each transient triumph on the eternal quest
ABAB
poet ! if on a lasting fame be bent
thy unperturbing hopes , thou will not roam
too far from thine own happy heart and home
cling to the lowly earth , and be content
ABBA
so shall thy name be dear to many a heart
so shall the noblest truths by thee be taught
the flower and fruit of wholesome human thought
bless the sweet labors of thy gentle art
ABBA
the brightest stars are nearest to the earth
and we may track the mighty sun above
even by the shadow of a slender flower
always , o bard , humility is power
AABB
to speak of him in language of our own
is not for us too daringly to try
but , saviour , we can read thy history
upon the faces round thy humble throne
ABBA
and as the flower among the grass makes known
what summer suns have warmed it from the sky
as every human smile and human sigh
is witness that we do not live alone
ABBA
so in that company — in those sweet tears
the first born of a rugged melted heart
in those gaunt chains for ever torn apart
and in the words that weeping mother hears
ABBA
the scourge of life , and death 's extreme disgrace
the smoke of hell , the monster called pain
long shamed to be accursed in every place
by them who of his rude resort complain
ABAB
like crafty wretch , by time and travel taught
his ugly evil in others ’ good to hide
late harbours in her face , whom nature wrought
as treasure house where her best gifts do bide
ABAB
and so by privilege of sacred seat
a seat where beauty shines and virtue reigns
he hopes for some small praise , since she hath great
within her beams wrapping his cruel stains
ABAB
alack what poverty my muse brings forth
that having such a scope to show her pride
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside
ABAB
o blame me not if i no more can write
look in your glass and there appears a face
that over goes my blunt invention quite
dulling my lines , and doing me disgrace
ABAB
were it not sinful then striving to mend
to mar the subject that before was well
for to no other pass my verses tend
than of your graces and your gifts to tell
ABAB
voice of the holy spirit , making known
man to himself , a witness swift and sure
warning , approving , true and wise and pure
counsel and guidance that misleadeth none
ABBA
take healthful meanings fitted to our needs
and in the soul 's vernacular express
the common law of simple righteousness
hatred of cant and doubt of human creeds
ABBA
the last and greatest herald of heaven 's king
girt with rough skins , hies to the deserts wild
among that savage brood the woods forth bring
which he more harmless found than man , and mild
ABAB
his food was locusts , and what there doth spring
with honey that from virgin hives distill 'd
parch 'd body , hollow eyes , some uncouth thing
made him appear , long since from earth exiled
ABAB
there burst he forth ; ‘ all ye whose hopes rely
on god , with me amidst these deserts mourn
repent , repent , and from old errors turn
who listen 'd to his voice , obey 'd his cry
ABBA
unto the boundless ocean of thy beauty
runs this poor river , charged with streams of zeal
returning thee the tribute of my duty
which here my love , my youth , my plaints reveal
ABAB
look on the dear expenses of my youth
and see how just i reckon with thine eyes
examine well thy beauty with my truth
and cross my cares ere greater sums arise
ABAB
my poet , thou canst touch on all the notes
god set between his after and before
and strike up and strike off the general roar
of the rushing worlds a melody that floats
ABBA
in a serene air purely . antidotes
of medicated music , answering for
mankind 's forlornest uses , thou canst pour
from thence into their ears . god 's will devotes
ABBA
thine to such ends , and mine to wait on thine
how , dearest , wilt thou have me for most use
a hope , to sing by gladly ? or a fine
sad memory , with thy songs to interfuse
ABAB
fair room , the presence of sweet beauties pride
this place the sun upon the earth did hold
when phaeton his chariot did misguide
the tower where jove rain 'd down himself in gold
ABAB
now with her lemman is this phoebus ’ wife
the crow he sayeth nothing , for his life
caged hangeth he , and sayeth not a word
but when that home was come phoebus the lord
AABB
he singeth out , and saith ,— “ cuckoo ! cuckoo
“ hey ! ” crieth phoebus , “ here be something new
thy song was wont to cheer me . what is this
“ by jove ! ” quoth corvus , “ i sing not amiss
AABB
such war the immortals wage ; such horrors rend
the world ’ s vast concave , when the gods contend
first silver shafted phoebus took the plain
against blue neptune , monarch of the main
AABB
the god of arms his giant bulk display ’ d
opposed to pallas , war ’ s triumphant maid
against latona march ’ d the son of may
the quiver ’ d dian , sister of the day
AABB
( her golden arrows sounding at her side
saturnia , majesty of heaven , defied
with fiery vulcan last in battle stands
the sacred flood that rolls on golden sands
AABB
my love , i have no fear that thou shouldst die
albeit i ask no fairer life than this
whose numbering clock is still thy gentle kiss
while time and peace with hands enlock è d fly
ABBA
love hath so purified my being 's core
meseems i scarcely should be startled even
to find , some morn , that thou hadst gone before
since , with thy love , this knowledge too was given
ABAB
though god , as one that is an householder
called these to labour in his vine yard first
before the husk of darkness was well burst
bidding them grope their way out and bestir
ABBA
( who , questioned of their wages , answered , ‘ sir
unto each man a penny : ’ ) though the worst
burthen of heat was theirs and the dry thirst
though god hath since found none such as these were
ABBA
but art made fierce reply , “ anathema
on you who fill flesh but the spirit scorn
who give it to the unrequiting law
of your brute soullessness and heart unborn
ABAB
to aught than barter in your low bazaar
though beauty die for it from star to star
you are the god of judas and those who
betrayed him unto nail and thorn and sword
AABB
of that relentless worm bit florence horde
who drove lone dante from them till he grew
so great in death they begged his bones to strew
their pride and wealth and useless praise upon
ABBA
the battle quickly raged ; alike they erred
the pirates slaughter loved , and blood preferred
and , long accustomed to the stormy tide
were most expert , and on their skill relied
AABB
in numbers , too , superior they were found
but hisipal 's valour greatly shone around
and kept the combat undecided long
at length grifonio , wond'rous large and strong
AABB
with twenty sturdy , pirates got on board
and many soon lay gasping by the sword
where'er he trod , grim death and horrour reigned
at length , the round the noble hispal gained
AABB
about a mile behind the viny banks
how sweet it was , upon a sloping green
sunspread , and shaded with a branching screen
to lie in peace half murmuring words of thanks
ABBA
to see the mountains on each other climb
with spaces for rich meadows flowery bright
the winding river freshening the sight
at intervals , the trees in leafy prime
ABBA
the distant village roofs of blue and white
with intersections of quaint fashioned beams
all slanting crosswise , and the feudal gleams
of ruined turrets , barren in the light
ABBA
point to the summits where the brave have bled
where every village claims its glorious dead
say , when their bosoms met the bayonet 's shock
their only corselet was the rustic frock
AABB
say , when they mustered to the gathering horn
the titled chieftain curled his lip in scorn
yet , when their leader bade his lines advance
no musket wavered in the lion 's glance
AABB
say , when they fainted in the forced retreat
they tracked the snow drifts with their bleeding feet
yet still their banners , tossing in the blast
bore ever ready , faithful to the last
AABB
he had no children , who for love of men
being god , endured of gods such things as thou
father ; nor on his thunder beaten brow
fell such a woe as bows thine head again
ABBA
twice bowed before , though godlike , in man 's ken
and seen too high for any stroke to bow
save this of some strange god 's that bends it now
the third time with such weight as bruised it then
ABBA
fain would grief speak , fain utter for love 's sake
some word ; but comfort who might bid thee take
what god in your own tongue shall talk with thee
showing how all souls that look upon the sun
AABB
the heavenly branches did i see arise
out of the fresh and lustie lawrell tree
amidst the yong greene wood : of paradise
some noble plant i thought my selfe to see
ABAB
that day we brought our beautiful one to lie
in the green peace within your gates , he came
to give us greeting , boyish and kind and shy
and , stricken as we were , we blessed his name
ABAB
yet , like the creature of light that had been ours
soon of the sweet earth disinherited
he too must join , even with the year 's old flowers
the unanswering generations of the dead
ABAB
so stand we friends for you , who stood our friend
through him that day ; for now through him you know
that though where love was , love is till the end
love , turned of death to longing , like a foe
ABAB
march , tho ’ the hours of promise with bright ray
may gild thy noons , yet , on wild pinion borne
loud winds more often rudely wake thy morn
and harshly hymn thy early closing day
ABBA
still the chill 'd earth wears , with her tresses shorn
her bleak , grey garb :— yet not for this we mourn
nor , as in winter 's more enduring sway
with festal viands , and associates gay
AABB
arm ‘ gainst the skies ;— nor shun the piercing gale
but , with blue cheeks , and with disorder 'd hair
meet its rough breath ;— and peep for primrose pale
or lurking violet , under hedges bare
ABAB
since the first look that led me to this error
to this thoughts ’ maze to my confusion tending
still have i lived in grief , in hope , in terror
the circle of my sorrows never ending
ABAB
still must i whet my young desires abated
upon the flint of such a heart rebelling
and all in vain ; her pride is so innated
she yields no place at all for pity 's dwelling
ABAB
to live in hell , and heaven to behold
to welcome life , and die a living death
to sweat with heat , and yet be freezing cold
to grasp at stars , and lie the earth beneath
ABAB
to treat a maze that never shall have end
to burn in sighs , and starve in daily tears
to climb a hill , and never to descend
giants to kill , and quake at childish fears
ABAB
to pine for food , and watch th ’ hesperian tree
to thirst for drink , and nectar still to draw
to live accurs 'd whom men hold blest to be
and weep those wrongs which never creature saw
ABAB
my love amazed did blush herself to see
pictured by art , all naked as she was
“ how could the painter know so much by me
or art effect what he hath brought to pass
ABAB
it is not like he naked me hath seen
or stood so nigh for to observe so much
no , sweet ; his eyes so near have never been
nor could his hands by art have cunning such
ABAB
i showed my heart , wherein you printed were
you , naked you , as here you painted are
in that my love your picture i must wear
and show't to all , unless you have more care
AABB
thou who didst waken from his summer dreams
the blue mediterranean , where he lay
lull 'd by the coil of his crystalline streams
beside a pumice isle in baiae 's bay
ABAB
and saw in sleep old palaces and towers
quivering within the wave 's intenser day
all overgrown with azure moss and flowers
so sweet , the sense faints picturing them ! thou
ABAB
for whose path the atlantic 's level powers
cleave themselves into chasms , while far below
the sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear
the sapless foliage of the ocean , know
ABAB
not mine own fears , nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world , dreaming on things to come
can yet the lease of my true love control
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
ABAB
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
and the sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age
ABAB
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh , and death to me subscribes
since spite of him i 'll live in this poor rhyme
while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes
ABAB
thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer , when from thee i speed
from where thou art , why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
ABAB
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
ABAB
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
therefore desire ( of perfect'st love being made
shall neigh ( no dull flesh ) in his fiery race
but love , for love , thus shall excuse my jade
ABAB
but he lay in peace , with his solemn eye
looking far through the mists of futurity
a smile gleamed over the death dew that lay
on his withered cheek as life ebbed away
AABB
a darkness lay on his forehead vast
but the light of expectancy o'er it was cast
a light that shone from the coming day
travelling unseen to the east away
AABB
in his cloudy robes that lay shadowing wide
i stretched myself motionless by his side
and his eyes with their calm , unimpassioned power
soothing my heart like an evening shower
AABB
perhaps some village poet waited there
who day and night toiled hard in metres rare
to sing the deeds and virtues of his prince
and trace them on the leaves of that lone palm
AABB
o lest the world should task you to recite
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death ( dear love ) forget me quite
for you in me can nothing worthy prove
ABAB
unless you would devise some virtuous lie
to do more for me than mine own desert
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart
ABAB
o lest your true love may seem false in this
that you for love speak well of me untrue
my name be buried where my body is
and live no more to shame nor me , nor you
ABAB
“ hence the first accents bear in airy rings
the vocal symbols of ideal things
name each nice change appulsive powers supply
to the quick sense of touch , or ear or eye
AABB
or in fine traits abstracted forms suggest
of beauty , wisdom , number , motion , rest
or , as within reflex ideas move
trace the light steps of reason , rage , or love
AABB
the next new sounds adjunctive thoughts recite
as hard , odorous , tuneful , sweet , or white
the next the fleeting images select
of action , suffering , causes and effect
AABB
in vaine i seeke and sew to her for grace
and doe myne humbled hart before her poure
the whiles her foot she in my necke doth place
and tread my life downe in the lowly floure
ABAB
and yet the lyon , that is lord of power
and reigneth over every beast in field
in his most pride disdeigneth to devoure
the silly lambe that to his might doth yield
ABAB
how languisheth the primrose of love 's garden
how trill her tears , th ’ elixir of my senses
ambitious sickness , what doth thee so harden
oh spare , and plague thou me for her offences
ABAB
ah roses , love 's fair roses , do not languish
blush through the milk white veil that holds you covered
if heat or cold may mitigate your anguish
i 'll burn , i 'll freeze , but you shall be recovered
ABAB
good god , would beauty mark now she is crased
how but one shower of sickness makes her tender
her judgments then to mark my woes amazed
to mercy should opinion 's fort surrender
ABAB
when hither you come , do enter our door
i 'll give you my hand , perhaps something more
let me urge , if inclined , to this you 'll reply
i 'll again do my best , yes , surely i 'll try
AABB
the fair one who brings it ought sure to inspire
some poetical lay from genius ’ sweet lyre
but genius repels me , she “ turns a deaf ear
and frowns on me scornful , the year after year
AABB
perhaps if i sue , in the “ sere yellow leaf
she 'll open her heart , and yield me relief
but wayward my pen , i must now bid adieu
my friendship , dear madam , i offer to you
AABB
the lab'ring poor , in spite of double pay
are saucy , mutinous , and beggarly
so lavish of their money and their time
that want of forecast is the nation 's crime
AABB
good drunken company is their delight
and what they get by day they spend by night
dull thinking seldom does their heads engage
but drink their youth away , and hurry on old age
AABB
empty of all good husbandry and sense
and void of manners most when void of pence
their strong aversion to behaviour 's such
they always talk too little or too much
AABB
earth has not any thing to shew more fair
dull would he be of soul who could pass by
a sight so touching in it 's majesty
this city now doth like a garment wear
ABBA
the beauty of the morning ; silent , bare
ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples lie
open unto the fields , and to the sky
all bright and glittering in the smokeless air
ABBA
never did sun more beautifully steep
in his first splendor valley , rock , or hill
ne'er saw i , never felt , a calm so deep
the river glideth at his own sweet will
ABAB
some foreign writers , some our own despise
the ancients only , or the moderns prize
thus wit , like faith , by each man is applied
to one small sect , and all are damned beside
AABB
meanly they seek the blessing to confine
and force that sun but on a part to shine
which not alone the southern wit sublimes
but ripens spirits in cold northern climes
AABB
which from the first has shone on ages past
enlights the present , and shall warm the last
though each may feel increases and decays
and see now clearer and now darker days
AABB
a peevish husband makes a peevish wife
and so brings scandal on a married life
no wonder then if sickness and disease
brought on by crosses , doth the body seize
AABB
all this is owing to a hair brain 'd man
whose base ill nature all the strife began
then why shou 'd women thus be stil 'd a curse
when man himself perhaps is ten times worse
AABB
perhaps you 'll say this is proposterous
in blaming others i my self expose
i answer thus , if it was not for shame
i 'd this same minute quite disown the name
AABB
still as the silence round about his lair
forest on forest hung about his head
like cloud on cloud . no stir of air was there
not so much life as on a summer 's day
ABAB
the latian virgins , valiant with despair
arm 'd on the tow'rs , the common danger share
so much of zeal their country 's cause inspir 'd
so much camilla 's great example fir 'd
AABB
poles , sharpen 'd in the flames , from high they throw
with imitated darts , to gall the foe
their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath
and crowd each other to be first in death
AABB
meantime to turnus , ambush 'd in the shade
with heavy tidings came th ’ unhappy maid
“ the volscians overthrown , camilla kill 'd
the foes , entirely masters of the field
AABB
i scarcely grieve , o nature ! at the lot
that pent my life within a city 's bounds
and shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds
perhaps i had not learned , if some lone cot
ABBA
had nursed a dreamy childhood , what the mart
taught me amid its turmoil ; so my youth
had missed full many a stern but wholesome truth
here , too , o nature ! in this haunt of art
ABBA
thy power is on me , and i own thy thrall
there is no unimpressive spot on earth
the beauty of the stars is over all
and day and darkness visit every hearth
ABAB
when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days , in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent
ABBA
to serve therewith my maker , and present
my true account , lest he returning chide
“ doth god exact day labor , light denied
i fondly ask ; but patience , to prevent
ABBA
that murmur , soon replies : “ god doth not need
either man 's work , or his own gifts ; who best
bear his mild yoke , they serve him best ; his state
is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed
ABBA
oh ! stars , that through the darkness smile and gleam
like glory rays that gild the dreary gloom
or like some soul world glance or mystic dream
that from the mind 's vast store of summer bloom
ABAB
we feel at times — your influence comes to raise
our hearts above earth 's night of doubts and haze
for all these holy thoughts of peace , that spring
from hearts at rest from daytime cares and pains
AABB
but oh ! thou bitter step mother and hard
to thy poor , fenceless , naked child — the bard
a thing unteachable in world 's skill
and half an idiot too , more helpless still
AABB
no heels to bear him from the op'ning dun
no claws to dig , his hated sight to shun
no horns , but those by luckless hymen worn
and those , alas ! not , amalthea 's horn
AABB
no nerves olfact'ry , mammon 's trusty cur
clad in rich dulness ’ comfortable fur
in naked feeling , and in aching pride
he bears th ’ unbroken blast from ev'ry side
AABB
sole lord of lords and very king of kings
he sits within the desert , carved in stone
inscrutable , colossal , and alone
and ancienter than memory of things
ABBA
graved on his front the sacred beetle clings
disdain sits on his lips ; and in a frown
scorn lives upon his forehead for a crown
the affrighted ostrich dare not dust her wings
ABBA
anear this presence . the long caravan 's
dazed camels stop , and mute the bedouins stare
this symbol of past power more than man 's
presages doom . kings look — and kings despair
ABAB
but yet my lonely spirit follows thine
as round the rolling earth night follows day
but yet thy lights on my horizon shine
into my night when thou art far away
ABAB
thus live undying through the lapse of time
the solemn legends of the warrior 's clime
like egypt 's pyramid or paestum 's fane
they stand the heralds of the voiceless plain
AABB
yet not like them , for time , by slow degrees
saps the gray stone and wears the embroidered frieze
and isis sleeps beneath her subject nile
and crumbled neptune strews his dorian pile
AABB
but art 's fair fabric , strengthening as it rears
its laurelled columns through the mist of years
as the blue arches of the bending skies
still gird the torrent , following as it flies
AABB
in english glades they watch the cyprian glow
and all the maenad melodies they know
they hear strange voices in a london street
and track the silver gleam of rushing feet
AABB
and these are things that come not to the view
of slippered dons who read a codex through
o honeyed poet , will you praise no more
the moonlit garden and the midnight shore
AABB
brother , have you forgotten how to sing
the story of that weak and cautious king
who reigned two hundred years in trebizond
you who would ever strive to pierce beyond
AABB
what secret thing of splendour or of shade
surmised in all those wandering ways wherein
man , led of love and life and death and sin
strays , climbs , or cowers , allured , absorbed , afraid
ABBA
might not the strong and sunlike sense invade
of that full soul that had for aim to win
light , silent over time 's dark toil and din
life , at whose touch death fades as dead things fade
ABBA
o spirit of man , what mystery moves in thee
that he might know not of in spirit , and see
the heart within the heart that seems to strive
the life within the life that seems to be
AABB
oft , when the world imagine women stray
the sylphs thro ’ mystic mazes guide their way
thro ’ all the giddy circle they pursue
and old impertinence expel by new
AABB
what tender maid but must a victim fall
to one man 's treat , but for another 's ball
when florio speaks what virgin could withstand
if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand
AABB
with varying vanities , from ev'ry part
they shift the moving toyshop of their heart
where wigs with wigs , with sword knots sword knots strive
beaux banish beaux , and coaches coaches drive
AABB
the silver trumpets rang across the dome
the people knelt upon the ground with awe
and borne upon the necks of men i saw
like some great god , the holy lord of rome
ABBA
priest like , he wore a robe more white than foam
and , king like , swathed himself in royal red
three crowns of gold rose high upon his head
in splendour and in light the pope passed home
ABBA
my heart stole back across wide wastes of years
to one who wandered by a lonely sea
and sought in vain for any place of rest
‘ foxes have holes , and every bird its nest
AABB
i meet not mine by others ’ discontent
for none compares with me in true devotion
yet though my tears and sighs to her be spent
her cruel heart disdains what they do motion
ABAB
yet though persisting in eternal hate
to aggravate the cause of my complaining
her fury ne'er confineth with a date
i will not cease to love , for her disdaining
ABAB
such puny thoughts of unresolv è d ground
whose inaudacity dares but base conceit
in me and my love never shall be found
those coward thoughts unworthy minds await
ABAB
i do not now complain of my disgrace
o cruel fair one ! fair with cruel crost
nor of the hour , season , time , nor place
nor of my foil , for any freedom lost
ABAB
nor of the steel that sticks within my wound
nor of my thoughts , by worser thoughts defaced
nor of the life i labour to confound
but i complain , that being thus disgraced
ABAB
loudly we shouted , and living and dying
bore them all backward with strength and strong crying
and caleb struck zedek hard at the throat
and japhia of lachish zebulon smote
AABB
the war swords and axes were clashing and groaning
the fallen were fighting and foaming and moaning
the war spears were breaking , the war horns were braying
ere the hands of the slayers were sated with slaying
AABB
and deep in the grasses grown gory and sodden
the treaders of all men were trampled and trodden
and over them , routed and reeled like cattle
high over the turn of the tide of the battle
AABB
you , while in life , are honoured as divine
and vows and oaths are taken at your shrine
so rome pays homage to her man of men
ne'er seen on earth before , ne'er to be seen again
AABB
but this wise nation , which for once thinks true
that nought in greece or here can rival you
to all things else a different test applies
and looks on living worth with jaundiced eyes
AABB
while , as for ancient models , take the code
which to the ten wise men our fathers owed
the treaties made ‘ twixt gabii 's kings and home 's
the pontiffs ’ books , the bards ’ forgotten tomes
AABB
far in the void of heaven a secret way
leads from the mansions of empyreal day
that wanders devious from the road of light
and deepens gradual into central night
AABB
by this dim path he sought the dark profound
of utmost hell , creation 's flaming bound
saw the far distant gleam , and heard the roar
of dashing surges on the burning shore
AABB
with hasty steps he trod the deep descent
thro ’ the gross air , that brighten 'd as he went
and call 'd a spirit from the gulphs below
heaven 's scourge , and minister of human woe
AABB
woe ! woe to me , on me return the smart
my burning tongue hath bred my mistress pain
for oft in pain , to pain my painful heart
with her due praise did of my state complain
ABAB
i praised her eyes , whom never chance doth move
her breath , which makes a sour answer sweet
her milken breasts , the nurse of child like love
her legs , o legs ! her aye well stepping feet
ABAB
pain heard her praise , and full of inward fire
( first sealing up my heart as prey of his
he flies to her , and , boldened with desire
her face , this age 's praise , the thief doth kiss
ABAB
i watched them long in my curious dream
till they stood by the border of the stream
then , just as i thought , the two ways met
but all the brethren were talking yet
AABB
and would talk on , till the heaving tide
carried them over , side by side
side by side , for the way was one
the toilsome journey of life was done
AABB
and priest and quaker , and all who died
came out alike on the other side
no forms or crosses , or books had they
no gowns of silk , or suits of gray
AABB
so she with flattring smyles weake harts doth guyde
unto her love , and tempte to theyr decay
whome , being caught , she kills with cruell pryde
and feeds at pleasure on the wretched pray
ABAB
yet even whylst her bloody hands them slay
her eyes looke lovely , and upon them smyle
that they take pleasure in their cruell play
and , dying , doe themselves of payne beguyle
ABAB
o sacred , just , inevitable scorn
strong child of righteous judgment , whom with grief
the rent heart bears , and wins not yet relief
seeing of its pain so dire a portent born
ABBA
must thou not spare one sheaf of all the corn
one doit of all the treasure ? not one sheaf
not one poor doit of all ? not one dead leaf
of all that fell and left behind a thorn
ABBA
is man so strong that one should scorn another
is any as god , not made of mortal mother
that love should turn in him to gall and flame
nay : but the true is not the false heart 's brother
AABB
if thou hadst been a painter , what fresh looks
what shining of pent glories , what new grace
had burst upon us from the great earth 's face
how had we read , as in new languaged books
ABBA
clear love of god in lone retreating nooks
a lily , as thy hand its form would trace
were plainly seen god 's child , of lower race
and , o my heart , blue hills ! and grassy brooks
ABBA
thy soul lay to all undulations bare
answering in waves . each morn the sun did rise
and god 's world woke beneath life giving skies
thou sawest clear thy father 's meanings there
ABBA
thou canst not die whilst any zeal abound
in feeling hearts than can conceive these lines
though thou a laura hast no petrarch found
in base attire yet clearly beauty shines
ABAB
but i may add one feather to thy fame
to help her flight throughout the fairest isle
and if my pen could more enlarge thy name
then shouldst thou live in an immortal style
ABAB
within a thick and spreading hawthorn bush
that overhung a mole hill large and round
i heard from morn to morn a merry thrush
sing hymns of rapture , while i drank the sound
ABAB
with joy ; and oft , an unintruding guest
i watch 'd her secret toils from day to day
how true she warp 'd the moss to form her nest
and modell 'd it within with wool and clay
ABAB
and bye and bye , like heath bells gilt with dew
there lay her shining eggs as bright as flowers
ink spotted over , shells of green and blue
and there i witness 'd , in the summer hours
ABAB
fair star of evening , splendor of the west
star of my country ! on the horizon 's brink
thou hangest , stooping , as might seem , to sink
on england 's bosom ; yet well pleas 'd to rest
ABBA
meanwhile , and be to her a glorious crest
conspicuous to the nations . thou , i think
should'st be my country 's emblem ; and should'st wink
bright star ! with laughter on her banners , drest
ABBA
in thy fresh beauty . there ! that dusky spot
beneath thee , it is england ; there it lies
blessings be on you both ! one hope , one lot
one life , one glory ! i , with many a fear
ABAB
that scarce a piece i publish in a year
idle perhaps to you i may appear
but rather , that i write at all , admire
when i am often robbed of days entire
AABB
now with my friends the evening i must spend
to those preferred my compliments must send
now at the witnessing a will make one
hurried from this to that , my morning 's gone
AABB
some office must attend ; or else some ball
or else my lawyer 's summons to the hall
now a rehearsal , now a concert hear
and now a latin play at westminster
AABB
but they came ,— the wind and sea
and rain and thunder , that in giant glee
sang o'er the lightnings pale , as to and fro
they writhed , like stricken angels !— white as snow
AABB
roll 'd billow after billow , and the tide
came forward as an army deep and wide
to charge with all its waters . there was heard
a murmur far and far , of those that stirr 'd
AABB
within the great encampment of the sea
and dark they were , and lifted terribly
their water spouts like banners . it was grand
to see the black battalions , hand in hand
AABB
so , as thou wert the seed and not the flower
having no form or comeliness , in chief
sharing thy thoughts with thine acquaintance grief
thou wert despised , rejected in thine hour
ABBA
of loneliness and god triumphant power
oh , not three days alone , glad slumber brief
that from thy travail brought thee sweet relief
lay'st thou , outworn , beneath thy stony bower
ABBA
but three and thirty years , a living seed
thy body lay as in a grave indeed
a heavenly germ dropt in a desert wide
buried in fallow soil of grief and need
AABB
so was it done , and ogier , armed right well
sleeping , was borne away by some strong spell
and set upon the flemish coast ; and thence
turned to st. omer 's , with a doubtful sense
AABB
of being in some wild dream , the while he knew
that great delight forgotten was his due
that all which there might hap was of small worth
so on he went , and sometimes unto mirth
AABB
did his attire move the country folk
but oftener when strange speeches from him broke
concerning men and things for long years dead
he filled the listeners with great awe and dread
AABB
meanwhile , ere yet on stockholm 's towery height
the morning planet shed its trembling light
a troop , with bernheirn , thro ’ the portals past
whose polish 'd arms a glimmering splendor cast
AABB
no single breath the general stillness stirr 'd
their trampling feet alone the warder heard
and follow 'd with his sight the dusty cloud
that in its mantle wrapp 'd the marching crowd
AABB
o'er crackling bushes scud the warrior train
and pass with haste the solitary plain
‘ till the broad sun discover 'd from afar
the dawning lustre of his golden car
AABB
if my dear love were but the child of state
it might for fortune 's bastard be unfathered
as subject to time 's love or to time 's hate
weeds among weeds , or flowers with flowers gathered
ABAB
no it was builded far from accident
it suffers not in smiling pomp , nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent
whereto th ’ inviting time our fashion calls
ABAB
it fears not policy that heretic
which works on leases of short numbered hours
but all alone stands hugely politic
that it nor grows with heat , nor drowns with showers
ABAB
when all the hungry pain of love i bear
and in poor lightless thought but burn and burn
and wit goes hunting wisdom everywhere
yet can no word of revelation learn
ABAB
when endlessly the scales of yea and nay
in dreadful motion fall and rise and fall
when all my heart in sorrow i could pay
until at last were left no tear at all
ABAB
then if with tame or subtle argument
companions come and draw me to a place
where words are but the tappings of content
and life spreads all her garments with a grace
ABAB
blown in the morning , thou shalt fade ere noon
what boots a life which in such haste forsakes thee
thou'rt wondrous frolic , being to die so soon
and passing proud a little color makes thee
ABAB
if thee thy brittle beauty so deceives
know then the thing that swells thee is thy bane
for the same beauty cloth , in bloody leaves
the sentence of thy early death contain
ABAB
some clown 's coarse lungs will poison thy sweet flower
if by the careless plough thou shalt be torn
and many herods lie in wait each hour
to murder thee as soon as thou art born
ABAB
if she with too loud mutt'ring ran away
as being much incens 'd to leave her play
a western , mild and pretty whispering gale
came dallying with the leaves along the dale
AABB
and seem 'd as with the water it did chide
because it ran so long unpacified
yea , and methought it bade her leave that coil
or he would choke her up with leaves and soil
AABB
from you have i been absent in the spring
when proud pied april ( dressed in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him
ABAB
yet nor the lays of birds , nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue
could make me any summer 's story tell
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
ABAB
nor did i wonder at the lily 's white
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
they were but sweet , but figures of delight
drawn after you , you pattern of all those
ABAB
strong time and fire swift change , with lightnings clad
and shod with thunders of reverberate years
have filled with light and sound of hopes and fears
the space of many a season , since i had
ABBA
fear not , but hope , though then time 's heart were weak
and heaven by hell shade stricken , and the range
of high born hope made questionable and strange
as twilight trembling till the sunlight speak
ABBA
check every outflash , every ruder sally
of thought and speech ; speak low , and give up wholly
thy spirit to mild minded melancholy
this is the place . through yonder poplar alley
ABBA
below , the blue green river windeth slowly
but in the middle of the sombre valley
the crisp è d waters whisper musically
and all the haunted place is dark and holy
ABBA
the fields have faded , the groves look dead
the summer is gone , its beauty has fled
and there breathes a low and plaintive sound
from each stream and solemn wood around
AABB
in unison with their tone , my breast
with a spirit of kindred gloom is opprest
and the sighs burst forth as i gaze , the while
on the crumbling stone of the reverend pile
AABB
and list to the sounds of the moaning wind
as it stirs the old ivy boughs entwined
sighs mournful along through chancel and nave
and shakes the loose panel and architrave
AABB
“ ‘ o friends , a thousand ways frail mortals lead
to the cold tomb , and dreadful all to tread
but dreadful most , when by a slow decay
pale hunger wastes the manly strength away
AABB
why cease ye then to implore the powers above
and offer hecatombs to thundering jove
why seize ye not yon beeves , and fleecy prey
arise unanimous ; arise and slay
AABB
and if the gods ordain a safe return
to phoebus shrines shall rise , and altars burn
but should the powers that o'er mankind preside
decree to plunge us in the whelming tide
AABB
when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent
ABBA
to serve therewith my maker , and present
my true account , lest he , returning , chide
‘ doth god exact day labour , light denied
i fondly ask : but patience , to prevent
ABBA
that murmur soon replies : ‘ god doth not need
either man 's work or his own gifts . who best
bear his mild yoke , they serve him best . his state
is kingly : thousands at his bidding speed
ABBA
i cannot syllable that unworded praise
an ashen sapling bending in thy wind
uplifting in thy light new budded leaves
nor for myself nor any other raise
ABBA
long unaccustomed brightness in their eyes
needs must seem beautiful in thine , bright lord
and to forget the part that sorrow had
in every shadowed breast , where still it lies
ABBA
afar in the desert i love to ride
with the silent bush boy alone by my side
o'er the brown karroo , where the bleating cry
of the springbok 's fawn sounds plaintively
AABB
and the timorous quagga 's shrill whistling neigh
is heard by the fountain at twilight gray
where the zebra wantonly tosses his mane
with wild hoof scouring the desolate plain
AABB
and the fleet footed ostrich over the waste
speeds like a horseman who travels in haste
hieing away to the home of her rest
where she and her mate have scooped their nest
AABB
small , busy flames play through the fresh laid coals
and their faint cracklings o'er our silence creep
like whispers of the household gods that keep
a gentle empire o'er fraternal souls
ABBA
and while , for rhymes , i search around the poles
your eyes are fix 'd , as in poetic sleep
upon the lore so voluble and deep
that aye at fall of night our care condoles
ABBA
if i could trust mine own self with your fate
shall i not rather trust it in god 's hand
without whose will one lily doth not stand
nor sparrow fall at his appointed date
ABBA
who numbereth the innumerable sand
who weighs the wind and water with a weight
to whom the world is neither small nor great
whose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned
ABBA
searching my heart for all that touches you
i find there only love and love 's goodwill
helpless to help and impotent to do
of understanding dull , of sight most dim
ABAB
i went to listen to my teacher friend
o friend above , thanks for the friend below
who having been made wise , deep things to know
with brooding spirit over them doth bend
ABBA
until they waken words , as wings , to send
their seeds far forth , seeking a place to grow
the lesson past , with quiet foot i go
and towards his silent room , expectant wend
ABBA
seeking a blessing , even leave to dwell
for some eternal minutes in his eyes
and he smiled on me in his loving wise
his hand spoke friendship , satisfied me well
ABBA
much have i travell 'd in the realms of gold
and many goodly states and kingdoms seen
round many western islands have i been
which bards in fealty to apollo hold
ABBA
oft of one wide expanse had i been told
that deep brow 'd homer rul 'd as his demesne
yet did i never breathe its pure serene
till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold
ABBA
then felt i like some watcher of the skies
when a new planet swims into his ken
or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes
he star 'd at the pacific — and all his men
ABAB
sulphureous clouds rise reddening round the height
and veil the skies , and wrap the sounding fight
soon from the skirts of smoke , where thousands toil
ranks roll away and into light recoil
AABB
starke pours upon them in a storm of lead
his hosted swains bestrew the field with dead
pierce with strong bayonets the german reins
whelm two battalions in their captive chains
AABB
lyke as a huntsman , after weary chace
seeing the game from him escapt away
sits downe to rest him in some shady place
with panting hounds , beguiled of their pray
ABAB
are these wild thoughts , thus fettered in my rhymes
indeed the product of my heart and brain
how strange that on my ear the rhythmic strain
falls like faint memories of far off times
ABBA
when did i feel the sorrow , act the part
which i have striv'n to shadow forth in song
in what dead century swept that mingled throng
of mighty pains and pleasures through my heart
ABBA
not in the yesterdays of that still life
which i have passed so free and far from strife
but somewhere in this weary world i know
in some strange land , beneath some orient clime
AABB
my weary life , that lives unsatisfied
on the foiled off brink of being e ’ er but this
to whom the power to will hath been denied
and the will to renounce doth also miss
ABAB
my sated life , with having nothing sated
in the motion of moving pois è d aye
within its dreams from its own dreams abated
this life let the gods change or take away
ABAB
for this endless succession of empty hours
like deserts after deserts , voidly one
doth undermine the very dreaming powers
and dull even thought ’ s active inaction
ABAB
some time ago from rome , in smart array
a younger brother homeward bent his way
not much improved , as frequently the case
with those who travel to that famous place
AABB
upon the road oft finding , where he stayed
delightful wines , and handsome belle or maid
with careless ease he loitered up and down
one day there passed him in a country town
AABB
attended by a page , a lady fair
whose charming form and all engaging air
at once his bosom fired with fond desire
and nearer still , her beauties to admire
AABB
shame is a shadow cast by sin : yet shame
itself may be a glory and a grace
refashioning the sin disfashioned face
a nobler bruit than hollow sounded fame
ABBA
a new lit lustre on a tarnished name
one virtue pent within an evil place
strength for the fight , and swiftness for the race
a stinging salve , a life requickening flame
ABBA
a salve so searching we may scarcely live
a flame so fierce it seems that we must die
an actual cautery thrust into the heart
nevertheless , men die not of such smart
AABB
who , leaning on the belly of a pot
pourd foorth a water , whose out gushing flood
ran bathing all the creakie @ shore aflot
whereon the troyan prince spilt turnus blood
ABAB
and at his feete a bitch wolfe suck did yeeld
to two young babes : his left the palme tree stout
his right hand did the peacefull olive wield
and head with lawrell garnisht was about
ABAB
the goldfinch , who , to shun the scalding heat
had changed the medlar for a safer seat
and hid in bushes ‘ scaped the bitter shower
now perch 'd upon the lady of the flower
AABB
and either songster holding out their throats
and folding up their wings , renew 'd their notes
as if all day , precluding to the fight
they only had rehearsed , to sing by night
AABB
the banquet ended , and the battle done
they danced by star light and the friendly moon
and when they were to part , the laureate queen
supplied with steeds the lady of the green
AABB
look , how the flower which ling'ringly doth fade
the morning 's darling late , the summer 's queen
spoil 'd of that juice which kept it fresh and green
as high as it did raise , bows low the head
ABBA
right so the pleasures of my life being dead
or in their contraries but only seen
with swifter speed declines than erst it spread
and , blasted , scarce now shows what it hath been
ABAB
as doth the pilgrim , therefore , whom the night
by darkness would imprison on his way
think on thy home , my soul , and think aright
of what 's yet left thee of life 's wasting day
ABAB
had i a man 's fair form , then might my sighs
be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell
thine ear , and find thy gentle heart ; so well
would passion arm me for the enterprize
ABBA
but ah ! i am no knight whose foeman dies
no cuirass glistens on my bosom 's swell
i am no happy shepherd of the dell
whose lips have trembled with a maiden 's eyes
ABBA
yet must i dote upon thee ,— call thee sweet
sweeter by far than hybla 's honied roses
when steep 'd in dew rich to intoxication
ah ! i will taste that dew , for me ‘ tis meet
ABBA
a vast cathedral by the western sea
whose spires god set in majesty on high
peak after peak of forests to the sky
blended in one vast roof of greenery
ABBA
the nave , a river broadening to the sea
the aisles , deep canyons of eternal build
the transepts , valleys with god 's splendor filled
the shrines , white waterfalls in leaf laced drapery
ABBA
the choir stands westward by the sounding shore
the cliffs like beetling pipes set high in air
roll from the beach the thunders crashing there
the high wind voices chord the breakers ’ roar
ABBA
shall i compare thee to a summer 's day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summer 's lease hath all too short a date
ABAB
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimmed
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance , or nature 's changing course untrimmed
ABAB
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st
nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st
ABAB
if only in dreams may man be fully blest
is heaven a dream ? is she i clasped a dream
or stood she here even now where dewdrops gleam
and miles of furze shine golden down the west
ABBA
i seem to clasp her still — still on my breast
her bosom beats ,— i see the blue eyes beam
i think she kissed these lips , for now they seem
scarce mine : so hallowed of the lips they pressed
ABBA
the path runs straight between the flowering rows
a moonlit path , hemmed in by beds of bloom
where phlox and marigolds dispute for room
with tall , red dahlias and the briar rose
ABBA
‘ t is reckless prodigality which throws
into the night these wafts of rich perfume
which sweep across the garden like a plume
over the trees a single bright star glows
ABBA
dear garden of my childhood , here my years
have run away like little grains of sand
the moments of my life , its hopes and fears
have all found utterance here , where now i stand
ABAB
oh ! might these sighs and tears return again
into my breast and eyes which i have spent
that i might , in this holy discontent
mourn with some fruit , as i have mourned in vain
ABBA
in mine idolatry what showers of rain
mine eyes did waste ! what griefs my heart did rent
that sufferance was my sin i now repent
‘ cause i did suffer , i must suffer pain
ABBA
the hydroptic drunkard , and night scouting thief
the itchy lecher , and self tickling proud
have th ’ remembrance of past joys for relief
of coming ills . to poor me is allow 'd
ABAB
among the folks , to whom he visits paid
was neighbour peter , one who used the spade
a villager that god , in lieu of lands
had furnished only with a pair of hands
AABB
to dig and delve , and by the mattock gain
enough his wife and children to maintain
still youthful charms you in his spouse might trace
the weather injured solely had her face
AABB
but not the features which were perfect yet
some wish perhaps more blooming belles to get
the rustick truly me would ne'er have pleased
but such are oft by country parsons seized
AABB
o lords our gods , it is not that ye sit
serene above the thunder , and exempt
from strife of tongues and casualties that tempt
men merely found by proof of manhood fit
ABBA
for service of their fellows : this is it
which sets you past the reach of time 's attempt
which gives us right of justified contempt
for commonwealths built up by mere men 's wit
ABBA
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes
and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he
remembered in what a haughtier guise
he had flung an alms to leprosie
ABAB
when he caged his young life up in gilded mail
and set forth in search of the holy grail
the heart within him was ashes and dust
he parted in twain his single crust
AABB
he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink
and gave the leper to eat and drink
‘ twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread
‘ twas water out of a wooden bowl
AABB
whenas my love lay sickly in her bed
pale death did post in hope to have a prey
but she so spotless made him that he fled
“ unmeet to die , ” she cried , and could not stay
ABAB
back he retired , and thus the heavens he told
“ all things that are , are subject unto me
both towns , and men , and what the world doth hold
but her fair licia still immortal be
ABAB
the heavens did grant ; a goddess she was made
immortal , fair , unfit to suffer change
so now she lives , and never more shall fade
in earth a goddess , what can be more strange
ABAB
long hath my sufferance laboured to enforce
one pearl of pity from her pretty eyes
whilst i with restless rivers of remorse
have bathed the banks where my fair phillis lies
ABAB
the moaning lines which weeping i have written
and writing read unto my ruthful sheep
and reading sent with tears that never fitten
to my love 's queen , that hath my heart in keep
ABAB
have made my lambkins lay them down and sigh
but phillis sits , and reads , and calls them trifles
oh heavens , why climb not happy lines so high
to rent that ruthless heart that all hearts rifles
ABAB
some prouder muse , when comes the hour at last
may shake our hillsides with her bugle blast
not ours the task ; but since the lyric dress
relieves the statelier with its sprightliness
AABB
hear an old song , which some , perchance , have seen
in stale gazette or cobwebbed magazine
there was an hour when patriots dared profane
the mast that britain strove to bow in vain
AABB
and one , who listened to the tale of shame
whose heart still answered to that sacred name
whose eye still followed o'er his country 's tides
thy glorious flag , our brave old ironsides
AABB
hail oklahoma land ! o prairie plain
there is no state more dearly loved .— all hail
where grassy hills and sheltered cove and vale
rest quietly in peace — and in refrain
ABBA
our voices lift in praise and joy again
we sing of oklahoma land .— all hail
of sunny skies and even windy gale
and wealth of growing corn and flowing grain
ABBA
where black gold gleams and roses bloom in spring
here long roads stretch and grazing cow herds roam
we build in faith great churches and our state
with many schools , where children gaily sing
ABBA
never the heart of spring had trembled so
as on that day when first in paradise
we went afoot as novices to know
for the first time what blue was in the skies
ABAB
what fresher green than any in the grass
and how the sap goes beating to the sun
and tell how on the clocks of beauty pass
minute by minute till the last is done
ABAB
but not the new birds singing in the brake
and not the buds of our discovery
the deeper blue , the wilder green , the ache
for beauty that we shadow as we see
ABAB
in the old age black was not counted fair
or if it were it bore not beauty 's name
but now is black beauty 's successive heir
and beauty slandered with a bastard shame
ABAB
for since each hand hath put on nature 's power
fairing the foul with art 's false borrowed face
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
but is profaned , if not lives in disgrace
ABAB
therefore my mistress ’ eyes are raven black
her eyes so suited , and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation with a false esteem
ABAB
two days had passed , when came a youthful friend
fair nancy with her often would unbend
howe'er , so very thoughtful alice seemed
that nancy ( who was penetrating deemed
AABB
was well convinced whatever alice sought
so very absent she was not for naught
in questioning she managed with such art
that soon she learned — what alice could impart
AABB
to listen she was thoroughly disposed
while t'other ev'ry circumstance disclosed
from first to last , each point and mystick hit
and e'en the largeness of the friar 's wit
AABB
but near me , nearer , steals a deep eyed maid
with creeping glance that sees and will not see
and blush that would those yea sweet eyes upbraid
o , might i woo her nor inconstant be
ABAB
but is not autumn dreamtime of the spring
( yon scarlet fruit bell is a flower asleep
and i am not forsworn if yet i keep
dream faith with spring in autumn 's deeper kiss
ABBA
o wild west wind , thou breath of autumn 's being
thou , from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
are driven , like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing
yellow , and black , and pale , and hectic red
ABAB
thine azure sister of the spring shall blow
her clarion o'er the dreaming earth , and fill
( driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air
with living hues and odours plain and hill
ABAB
the stately beast the two tyrrhidae bred
snatch 'd from his dams , and the tame youngling fed
their father tyrrheus did his fodder bring
tyrrheus , chief ranger to the latian king
AABB
their sister silvia cherish 'd with her care
the little wanton , and did wreaths prepare
to hang his budding horns , with ribbons tied
his tender neck , and comb 'd his silken hide
AABB
and bathed his body . patient of command
in time he grew , and , growing us 'd to hand
he waited at his master 's board for food
then sought his salvage kindred in the wood
AABB
thou art the rock of empire , set mid seas
between the east and west , that god has built
advance thy roman borders where thou wilt
while run thy armies true with his decrees
ABBA
law , justice , liberty — great gifts are these
watch that they spread where english blood is spilt
lest , mixed and sullied with his country 's guilt
the soldier 's life stream flow , and heaven displease
ABBA
two swords there are : one naked , apt to smite
thy blade of war ; and , battle storied , one
rejoices in the sheath , and hides from light
american i am ; would wars were done
ABAB
lift up your eyes ! behold these pictured walls
look where the flood of western glory falls
through the great sunflower disk of blazing panes
in ruby , saffron , azure , emerald stains
AABB
with reverent step the marble pavement tread
where our proud mother 's martyr roll is read
see the great halls that cluster , gathering round
this lofty shrine with holiest memories crowned
AABB
see the fair matron in her summer bower
fresh as a rose in bright perennial flower
read on her standard , always in the van
“ truth , ” — the one word that makes a slave a man
AABB
care charmer sleep , son of the sable night
brother to death , in silent darkness born
relieve my languish , and restore the light
with dark forgetting of my care return
ABAB
and let the day be time enough to mourn
the shipwreck of my ill adventured youth
let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn
without the torment of the night 's untruth
ABAB
cease , dreams , the images of day desires
to model forth the passions of the morrow
never let rising sun approve you liars
to add more grief to aggravate my sorrow
ABAB
death , what hast thou to do with one for whom
time is not lord , but servant ? what least part
of all the fire that fed his living heart
of all the light more keen than sundawn 's bloom
ABBA
that lit and led his spirit , strong as doom
and bright as hope , can aught thy breath may dart
quench ? nay , thou knowest he knew thee what thou art
a shadow born of terror 's barren womb
ABBA
that brings not forth save shadows . what art thou
to dream , albeit thou breathe upon his brow
that power on him is given thee ,— that thy breath
can make him less than love acclaims him now
AABB
come no profane insatiate mortal near
with the contagion of his passionate ills
the smoke of battle all the valley fills
let the eternal sunlight greet me here
ABBA
this spot is sacred to the deeper soul
and to the piety that mocks no more
in nature 's inmost heart is no uproar
none in this shrine ; in peace the heavens roll
ABBA
there is a booming in the forest boughs
tremendous feet seem trampling through the trees
the storm is at his wildman revelries
and earth and heaven echo his carouse
ABBA
night reels with tumult ; and , from out her house
of cloud , the moon looks ,— like a face one sees
in nightmare ,— hurrying , with pale eyes that freeze
stooping above with white , malignant brows
ABBA
the isolated oak upon the hill
that seemed , at sunset , in terrific lands
a titan head black in a sea of blood
now seems a monster harp , whose wild strings thrill
ABBA
all curses be about her , and all ill
go with her ; heaven be dark above her way
the gulf beneath her glad and sure of prey
and , wheresoe'er her prow be pointed , still
ABBA
the winds of heaven have all one evil will
conspirant even as hearts of kings to slay
with mouths of kings to lie and smile and pray
and chiefliest his whose wintrier breath makes chill
ABBA
with more than winter 's and more poisonous cold
the horror of his kingdom toward the north
the deserts of his kingdom toward the east
and though death hide not in her direful hold
ABBA
pregnant with possibilities of crime
and full of felons for all coming time
your blood 's too precious to be lightly spilt
in testimony to a venial guilt
AABB
live to get whelpage and preserve a name
no praise can sweeten and no lie unshame
live to fulfill the vision that i see
down the dim vistas of the time to be
AABB
a dream of clattering beaks and burning eyes
of hungry ravens glooming all the skies
a dream of gleaming teeth and foetid breath
of jackals wrangling at the feast of death
AABB
there 's not a budding boy or girl , this day
but is got up , and gone to bring in may
a deal of youth , ere this , is come
back , and with white thorn laden home
AABB
some have despatched their cakes and cream
before that we have left to dream
and some have wept , and wooed and plighted troth
and chose their priest , ere we can cast off sloth
AABB
white , glittering sunlight fills the market square
spotted and sprigged with shadows . double rows
of bartering booths spread out their tempting shows
of globed and golden fruit , the morning air
ABBA
smells sweet with ripeness , on the pavement there
a wicker basket gapes and overflows
spilling out cool , blue plums . the market glows
and flaunts , and clatters in its busy care
ABBA
a stately minster at the northern side
lifts its twin spires to the distant sky
pinnacled , carved and buttressed ; through the wide
arched doorway peals an organ , suddenly
ABAB
“ oh ! adrian , my faint heart fain would dwell
forever here beneath thy love 's dear spell
but ah ! beyond the height where breaks the day
there lives a charm that calls my soul away
AABB
afar the mountains glow in pale , blue mist
by fleecy clouds and summer sunshine kissed
and see ! beyond them all i long to be
beyond this shore , beyond the trackless sea
AABB
ah ! this is why , dear adrian , we must part
although it rends my grieving , restless heart
forgive me if to night i 've caused thee pain
if grief be thine , forgive me once again
AABB
the husband , while the holy pastor spoke
appeared to grumble and his stars invoke
the wife was in a rage , and ‘ gan to scold
said she to peter , wretch that i behold
AABB
thou'lt be through life a prey to pain and grief
come not to me and bray and hope relief
the worthy pastor would have us procured
the means that might much comfort have ensured
AABB
can he deserve such treatment to receive
good mister john this goose i now would leave
and ev'ry morning , while he gathers fruits
or plants , herbs , cabbages , and various roots
AABB
with clytia he no longer was received
than while he was a man of wealth believed
balls , concerts , op'ras , tournaments , and plays
expensive dresses , all engaging ways
AABB
were used to captivate this lady fair
while scarcely one around but in despair
wife , widow , maid , his fond affection sought
to gain him , ev'ry wily art was brought
AABB
but all in vain :— by passion overpow'red
the belle , whose conduct others would have soured
to him appeared a goddess full of charms
superior e'en to helen , in his arms
AABB
gold counts for more than silver , all men hold
why doubt that virtue counts for more than gold
“ seek money first , good friends , and virtue next
each janus lectures on the well worn text
AABB
lads learn it for their lessons ; grey haired men
like schoolboys , drawl the sing song o'er again
you lack , say , some six thousand of the rate
the law has settled as a knight 's estate
AABB
though soul , tongue , morals , credit , all the while
are yours , you reckon with the rank and file
but mark those children at their play ; they sing
“ deal fairly , youngster , and we 'll crown you king
AABB
high in his chariot then halesus came
a foe by birth to troy 's unhappy name
from agamemnon born   to turnus ’ aid
a thousand men the youthful hero led
AABB
who till the massic soil , for wine renown 'd
and fierce auruncans from their hilly ground
and those who live by sidicinian shores
and where with shoaly fords vulturnus roars
AABB
cales ’ and osca 's old inhabitants
and rough saticulans , inur 'd to wants
light demi lances from afar they throw
fasten 'd with leathern thongs , to gall the foe
AABB
could i but picture her — ah , you would deem
my tale the figment of a poet 's dream
and if you saw her , ( could such bliss be given
you'ld think yourself in dreamland — or in heaven
AABB
not the red rapture of new wakened roses
when morning dew their soul of love uncloses
( roses that must be wooed ,— nor may be won
save by the prince of lovers , the warm sun
AABB
not the fair lily , nor the violet shy
whose heart 's love lurks deep in her still blue eye
nor any flower , the loveliest and the best
can image to you half the charm compressed
AABB
when i have borne in memory what has tamed
great nations , how ennobling thoughts depart
when men change swords for ledgers , and desert
the student 's bower for gold , some fears unnamed
ABBA
i had , my country ! am i to be blamed
but , when i think of thee , and what thou art
verily , in the bottom of my heart
of those unfilial fears i am ashamed
ABBA
but dearly must we prize thee ; we who find
in thee a bulwark of the cause of men
and i by my affection was beguiled
what wonder , if a poet , now and then
ABAB
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour , which doth in it live
ABAB
the canker blooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly
when summer 's breath their masked buds discloses
ABAB
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwooed , and unrespected fade
die to themselves . sweet roses do not so
of their sweet deaths , are sweetest odours made
ABAB
god who can bind the stars eternally
with but a breath of spirit speech , a thought
who can within earth 's arms lay the mad sea
unseverably , and count it as sheer naught
ABAB
with his all might could bind not you and me
for tho he pressed us heart to burning heart
and set then to the passion that enthralls
his sanction , still our souls stood e'er apart
ABAB
how can i thank thee for this gift of thine
digby , the dawn and day star of our age
forerunner thou of many a saint and sage
who since have fought and conquer 'd ‘ neath the sign
ABBA
thou hast left , as in a sacred shrine
what shrine more pure than thy unspotted page
the priceless relics , as a heritage
of loftiest thoughts and lessons most divine
ABBA
poet and teacher of sublimest lore
thou scornest not the painter 's mimic skill
and thus hath come , obedient to thy will
the outward form that calderon 's spirit wore
ABBA
“ oh bless 'd ulysses ! ( thus the king express 'd
his sudden rapture ) in thy consort bless 'd
not more thy wisdom than her virtue shined
not more thy patience than her constant mind
AABB
icarius ’ daughter , glory of the past
and model to the future age , shall last
the gods , to honour her fair fame , shall rise
( their great reward ) a poet in her praise
AABB
not such , o tyndarus ! thy daughter 's deed
by whose dire hand her king and husband bled
her shall the muse to infamy prolong
example dread , and theme of tragic song
AABB
if , when we meet , i 'm cropped in awkward style
by some uneven barber , then you smile
you smile , if , as it haps , my gown 's askew
if my shirt 's ragged while my tunic 's new
AABB
how , if my mind 's inconsequent , rejects
what late it longed for , what it loathed affects
shifts every moment , with itself at strife
and makes a chaos of an ordered life
AABB
builds castles up , then pulls them to the ground
keeps changing round for square and square for round
you smile not ; ‘ tis an every day affair
i need no doctor 's , no , nor keeper 's care
AABB
i saw a river swift , whose fomy billowes
did wash the ground work of an old great wall
i saw it cover 'd all with griesly shadowes
that with black horror did the ayre appall
ABAB
thereout a strange beast with seven heads arose
that townes and castles under her brest did coure
and seem 'd both milder beasts and fiercer foes
alike with equall ravine to devoure
ABAB
much was i mazde to see this monsters kinde
in hundred formes to change his fearefull hew
when as at length i saw the wrathfull winde
which blows cold storms , burst out of scithian mew
ABAB
o sugared talk , wherewith my thoughts do live
o brows , love 's trophy and my senses ’ shine
o charming smiles , that death or life can give
o heavenly kisses from a mouth divine
ABAB
o wreaths too strong , and trammels made of hair
o pearls inclos è d in an ebon pale
o rose and lilies in a field most fair
where modest white doth make the red seem pale
ABAB
o voice whose accents live within my heart
o heavenly hand that more than atlas holds
o sighs perfumed , that can release my smart
o happy they whom in her arms she folds
ABAB
what human form is this ? what form divine
and who are these that gaze upon his face
mild , beautiful , and full of heavenly grace
with whose reflected light the gazers shine
ABBA
saviour , who does not know it to be thine
who does not long to fill a gazer 's place
and yet there is no time , there is no space
to keep away thy servants from thy shrine
ABBA
here if we kneel , and watch with faithful eyes
thou art not too far for faithful eyes to see
thou art not too far to turn and look on me
to speak to me , and to receive my sighs
ABBA
children of later growth , we love the play
we love its heroes , be they grave or gay
from squeaking , peppery , devil defying punch
to roaring richard with his camel hunch
AABB
adore its heroines , those immortal dames
time 's only rivals , whom he never tames
whose youth , unchanging , lives while thrones decay
( age spares the pyramids and dejazet
AABB
the saucy aproned , razor tongued soubrette
the blond haired beauty with the eyes of jet
the gorgeous beings whom the viewless wires
lift to the skies in strontian crimsoned fires
AABB
i lift my heavy heart up solemnly
as once electra her sepulchral urn
and , looking in thine eyes , i over turn
the ashes at thy feet . behold and see
ABBA
it might be well perhaps . but if instead
thou wait beside me for the wind to blow
the grey dust up , . . . those laurels on thine head
o my beloved , will not shield thee so
ABAB
canst thou o cruel , say i love thee not
when i against my self with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of my self , all tyrant , for thy sake
ABAB
who hateth thee that i do call my friend
on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon
nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend
revenge upon my self with present moan
ABAB
what merit do i in my self respect
that is so proud thy service to despise
when all my best doth worship thy defect
commanded by the motion of thine eyes
ABAB
“ curse thee , life , i will live with thee no more
thou hast mocked me , starved me , beat my body sore
and all for a pledge that was not pledged by me
i have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly
AABB
and now i go . nor threat , nor easy vow
of tardy kindness can avail thee now
with me , whence fear and faith alike are flown
lonely i came , and i depart alone
AABB
this is my play 's last scene ; here heavens appoint
my pilgrimage 's last mile ; and my race
idly yet quickly run , hath this last pace
my span 's last inch , my minute 's latest point
ABBA
and gluttonous death will instantly unjoint
my body and soul , and i shall sleep a space
but my ever waking part shall see that face
whose fear already shakes my every joint
ABBA
then as my soul to heaven , her first seat , takes flight
and earth born body in the earth shall dwell
so fall my sins , that all may have their right
to where they 're bred , and would press me to hell
ABAB
the castle gate stands open now
and the wanderer is welcome to the hall
as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough
no longer scowl the turrets tall
ABAB
the summer 's long siege at last is o'er
when the first poor outcast went in at the door
she entered with him in disguise
and mastered the fortress by surprise
AABB
there is no spot she loves so well on ground
she lingers and smiles there the whole year round
the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land
has hall and bower at his command
AABB
see the sole bliss heaven could on all bestow
which who but feels can taste , but thinks can know
yet poor with fortune , and with learning blind
the bad must miss ; the good , untaught , will find
AABB
slave to no sect , who takes no private road
but looks through nature up to nature 's god
pursues that chain which links th ’ immense design
joins heaven and earth , and mortal and divine
AABB
sees , that no being any bliss can know
but touches some above , and some below
learns , from this union of the rising whole
the first , last purpose of the human soul
AABB
fair matchless nymph , respect but what i crave
my thoughts are true , and honour is my love
i fainting die whom yet a smile might save
you gave the wound , and can the hurt remove
ABAB
those eyes like stars that twinkle in the night
and cheeks like rubies pale in lilies dyed
those ebon hands that darting hath such might
that in my soul my love and life divide
ABAB
accept the passions of a man possessed
let love be loved and grant me leave to live
disperse those clouds that darkened have my rest
and let your heaven a sun like smile but give
ABAB
order is heaven 's first law : and , this confest
some are and must be greater than the rest
more rich , more wise ; but who infers from hence
that such are happier , shocks all common sense
AABB
heaven to mankind impartial we confess
if all are equal in their happiness
but mutual wants this happiness increase
all nature 's difference keeps all nature 's peace
AABB
condition , circumstance , is not the thing
bliss is the same in subject or in king
in who obtain defence or who defend
in him who is or him who finds a friend
AABB
her eyes swam fire , and her cheek was red
her full breast heaved as she darkly said
“ the coyote hides from the wind and rain
the wild horse flies from the hurricane
AABB
but who can flee from the half breed 's hate
that rises soon and that watches late
then went ; and i laughed jeanne 's fears afar
but i thought that wench was our evil star
AABB
fair is my love , and cruel as she 's fair
her brow shades frown , although her eyes are sunny
her smiles are lightning , though her pride despair
and her disdains are gall , her favours honey
ABAB
a modest maid , deck 'd with a blush of honour
whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love
the wonder of all eyes that look upon her
sacred on earth ; design 'd a saint above
ABAB
chastity and beauty , which are deadly foes
live reconciled friends within her brow
and had she pity to conjoin with those
then who had heard the plaints i utter now
ABAB
lord , if i love thee and thou lovest me
why need i any more these toilsome days
why should i not run singing up thy ways
straight into heaven , to rest myself with thee
ABBA
what need remains of death pang yet to be
if all my soul is quickened in thy praise
if all my heart loves thee , what need the amaze
struggle and dimness of an agony
ABBA
the last and greatest herald of heaven 's king
girt with rough skins , hies to the deserts wild
among that savage brood the woods forth bring
which he more harmless found than man , and mild
ABAB
his food was locusts , and what there doth spring
with honey that from virgin hives distill 'd
parch 'd body , hollow eyes , some uncouth thing
made him appear , long since from earth exiled
ABAB
there burst he forth ; ‘ all ye whose hopes rely
on god , with me amidst these deserts mourn
repent , repent , and from old errors turn
who listen 'd to his voice , obey 'd his cry
ABBA
mother whose womb brought forth our man of men
mother of shakespeare , whom all time acclaims
queen therefore , sovereign queen of english dames
throned higher than sat thy sonless empress then
ABBA
was it thy son 's young passion guided pen
which drew , reflected from encircling flames
a figure marked by the earlier of thy names
wife , and from all her wedded kinswomen
ABBA
marked by the sign of murderess ? pale and great
great in her grief and sin , but in her death
and anguish of her penitential breath
greater than all her sin or sin born fate
ABBA
if poisonous minerals , and if that tree
whose fruit threw death on ( else immortal ) us
if lecherous goats , if serpents envious
cannot be damn 'd , alas ! why should i be
ABBA
why should intent or reason , born in me
make sins , else equal , in me more heinous
and mercy being easy and glorious
to god , in his stern wrath why threatens he
ABBA
but who am i that dare dispute with thee
o god ! oh , of thine only worthy blood
and my tears , make a heavenly lethean flood
and drown in it my sins ’ black memory
ABBA
milton ! thou should'st be living at this hour
england hath need of thee : she is a fen
of stagnant waters : altar , sword and pen
fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower
ABBA
have forfeited their ancient english dower
of inward happiness . we are selfish men
oh ! raise us up , return to us again
and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power
ABBA
thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart
thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea
pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free
so didst thou travel on life 's common way
ABBA
245 steep 'd in fell poison , as his sharp teeth part
a thousand tongues in quick vibration dart
snatch the proud eagle towering o'er the heath
or pounce the lion , as he stalks beneath
AABB
or strew , as marshall 'd hosts contend in vain
250 with human skeletons the whiten 'd plain
— chain 'd at his root two scion demons dwell
breathe the faint hiss , or try the shriller yell
AABB
rise , fluttering in the air on callow wings
and aim at insect prey their little stings
255 so time 's strong arms with sweeping scythe erase
art 's cumberous works , and empires , from their base
AABB
so , as i then disarmed did remaine
a wicked ambush , which lay hidden long
in the close covert of her guilful eyen
thence breaking forth , did thick about me throng
ABAB
too feeble i t'abide the brunt so strong
was forst to yield my selfe into their hands
who , me captiving streight with rigorous wrong
have ever since kept me in cruell bands
ABAB
inland , within a hollow vale , i stood
and saw , while sea was calm and air was clear
the coast of france — the coast of france how near
drawn almost into frightful neighbourhood
ABBA
i shrunk ; for verily the barrier flood
was like a lake , or river bright and fair
a span of waters ; yet what power is there
what mightiness for evil and for good ! [ b
ABBA
even so doth god protect us if we be
virtuous and wise . winds blow , and waters roll
strength to the brave , and power , and deity
yet in themselves are nothing ! one decree
ABBA
there many an auncient trophee was addrest
and many a spoyle , and many a goodly show
which that brave races greatnes did attest
that whilome from the troyan blood did flow
ABAB
ravisht i was so rare a thing to vew
when lo ! a barbarous troupe of clownish fone
the honour of these noble boughs down threw
under the wedge i heard the tronck to grone
ABAB
not from without us , only from within
comes or can ever come upon us light
whereby the soul keeps ever truth in sight
no truth , no strength , no comfort man may win
ABBA
no grace for guidance , no release from sin
save of his own soul 's giving . deep and bright
as fire enkindled in the core of night
burns in the soul where once its fire has been
ABBA
the light that leads and quickens thought , inspired
to doubt and trust and conquer . so he said
whom sidney , flower of england , lordliest head
of all we love , loved : but the fates required
ABBA
seductive waltz !— though on thy native shore
even werter 's self proclaim 'd thee half a whore
werter — to decent vice though much inclined
yet warm , not wanton ; dazzled , but not blind
AABB
though gentle genlis , in her strife with sta ë l
would even proscribe thee from a paris ball
the fashion hails — from countesses to queens
and maids and valets waltz behind the scenes
AABB
wide and more wide thy witching circle spreads
and turns — if nothing else — at least our heads
with thee even clumsy cits attempt to bounce
and cockneys practise what they can n't pronounce
AABB
but , ah ! ye maids , beware the gipsy 's lures
she opens not the womb of time , but yours
oft has her hands the hapless marian wrung
marian , whom gay in sweetest strains has sung
AABB
the parson 's maid — sore cause had she to rue
the gipsy 's tongue ; the parson 's daughter too
long had that anxious daughter sighed to know
what vellum 's sprucy clerk , the valley 's beau
AABB
meant by those glances which at church he stole
her father nodding to the psalm 's slow drawl
long had she sighed ; at length a prophet came
by many a sure prediction known to fame
AABB
when old jack died , it seemed to us , some way
that all the other dogs in town were pained
with our bereavement , and some that were chained
even , unslipped their collars on that day
ABBA
to visit jack in state , as though to pay
a last , sad tribute there , while neighbors craned
their heads above the high board fence , and deigned
to sigh “ poor dog ! ” remembering how they
ABBA
had cuffed him , when alive , perchance , because
for love of them he leaped to lick their hands
now , that he could not , were they satisfied
we children thought that , as we crossed his paws
ABBA
“ deem not , devoid of elegance , the sage
by fancy 's genuine feelings unbeguil 'd
of painful pedantry the poring child
who turns of these proud domes the historic page
ABBA
now sunk by time , and henry 's fiercer rage
think'st thou the warbling muses never smil 'd
on his lone hours ? ingenuous views engage
his thoughts , on themes unclassic falsely styl 'd
ABAB
intent . while cloister 'd piety displays
her mouldering roll , the piercing eye explores
new manners , and the pomp of elder days
whence culls the pensive bard his pictur 'd stores
ABAB
“ thaumantia ! mount the winds , and stop their car
against the highest who shall wage the war
if furious yet they dare the vain debate
thus have i spoke , and what i speak is fate
AABB
their coursers crush ’ d beneath the wheels shall lie
their car in fragments , scatter ’ d o ’ er the sky
my lightning these rebellious shall confound
and hurl them flaming , headlong , to the ground
AABB
condemn ’ d for ten revolving years to weep
the wounds impress ’ d by burning thunder deep
so shall minerva learn to fear our ire
nor dare to combat hers and nature ’ s sire
AABB
sin of self love possesseth all mine eye
and all my soul , and all my every part
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart
ABAB
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true , no truth of such account
and for my self mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
ABAB
sweet is the cypresse , but his rynd is rough
sweet is the nut , but bitter is his pill
sweet is the broome flowre , but yet sowre enough
and sweet is moly , but his root is ill
ABAB
so every sweet with soure is tempred still
that maketh it be coveted the more
for easie things , that may be got at will
most sorts of men doe set but little store
ABAB
as where two raging venoms are united
which of themselves dissevered life would sever
the sickly wretch of sickness is acquited
which else should die , or pine in torments ever
ABAB
thus two united deaths keep me from dying
i burne in ice , and quake amidst the fire
no hope midst these extremes or favour spying
thus love makes me a martyr in his ire
ABAB
thus ardent spoke sohr á b . huj í r dismayed
paused ere reply the dangerous truth betrayed
trembling for rustem 's life the captive groaned
basely his country 's glorious boast disowned
AABB
and said the chief from distant china came
sohr á b abrupt demands the hero 's name
the name unknown , grief wrings his aching heart
and yearning anguish speeds her venom 'd dart
AABB
to him his mother gave the tokens true
he sees them all , and all but mock his view
when gloomy fate descends in evil hour
can human wisdom bribe her favouring power
AABB
yet grace , if thou repent , thou canst not lack
but who shall give thee that grace to begin
oh ! make thyself with holy mourning black
and red with blushing , as thou art with sin
ABAB
drawn with th'attractive virtue of her eyes
my touched heart turns it to that happy coast
my joyful north , where all my fortune lies
the level of my hopes desir è d most
ABAB
there where my delia , fairer than the sun
decked with her youth whereon the world doth smile
joys in that honour which her eyes have won
th'eternal wonder of our happy isle
ABAB
flourish , fair albion , glory of the north
neptune 's best darling , held between his arms
divided from the world as better worth
kept for himself , defended from all harms
ABAB
as when it happ'neth that some lovely town
unto a barbarous besieger falls
who both by sword and flame himself installs
and , shameless , it in tears and blood doth drown
ABBA
her beauty spoil 'd , her citizens made thralls
his spite yet cannot so her all throw down
but that some statue , pillar of renown
yet lurks unmaim 'd within her weeping walls
ABBA
so , after all the spoil , disgrace , and wreck
that time , the world , and death , could bring combined
amidst that mass of ruins they did make
safe and all scarless yet remains my mind
ABAB
is it thy will , thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
ABAB
is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
so far from home into my deeds to pry
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenure of thy jealousy
ABAB
o no , thy love though much , is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
ABAB
hark , hark , a voice amid the quiet intense
it is thy duty waiting thee without
rise from thy knees in hope , the half of doubt
a hand doth pull thee — it is providence
ABBA
open thy door straightway , and get thee hence
go forth into the tumult and the shout
work , love , with workers , lovers , all about
of noise alone is born the inward sense
ABBA
of silence ; and from action springs alone
the inward knowledge of true love and faith
then , weary , go thou back with failing breath
and in thy chamber make thy prayer and moan
ABBA
‘ what had i lost , if , conjugally kind
by nature hating , yet by vows confined
untaught the matrimonial bonds to slight
and coldly conscious of a husband 's right
AABB
you had faint drawn me with a form alone
a lawful lump of life by force your own
then , while your backward will retrenched desire
and unconcurring spirits lent no fire
AABB
i had been born your dull , domestic heir
load of your life , and motive of your care
perhaps been poorly rich , and meanly great
the slave of pomp , a cipher in the state
AABB
delia , these eyes that so admireth thine
have seen those walls which proud ambition reared
to check the world , how they entombed have lain
within themselves , and on them ploughs have eared
ABAB
yet never found that barbarous hand attained
the spoil of fame deserved by virtuous men
whose glorious actions luckily had gained
th'eternal annals of a happy pen
ABAB
and therefore grieve not if thy beauties die
though time do spoil thee of the fairest veil
that ever yet covered mortality
and must instar the needle and the rail
ABAB
there was never a sound beside the wood but one
and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground
what was it it whispered ? i knew not well myself
perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun
ABBA
the vengeful victor rages round the fields
with every weapon art or fury yields
by the long lance , the sword , or ponderous stone
whole ranks are broken , and whole troops o ’ erthrown
AABB
this , while yet warm distill ’ d the purple flood
but when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood
then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend
less keen those darts the fierce ilythiae send
AABB
( the powers that cause the teeming matron ’ s throes
sad mothers of unutterable woes
stung with the smart , all panting with the pain
he mounts the car , and gives his squire the rein
AABB
insult me not with tombs ! the monster cried
let closing clods thy coward carcase hide
but these brave bones , unburied on the plain
touch not with dust , nor dare with rites profane
AABB
let no curst earth conceal this gory head
nor songs proclaim the dreadful zamor dead
me , whom the hungry gods from plain to plain
have follow 'd , feasting on thy slaughter 'd train
AABB
me wouldst thou cover ? no ! from yonder sky
the wide beak 'd hawk , that now beholds me die
soon with his cowering train my flesh shall tear
and wolves and tigers vindicate their share
AABB
“ weave the warp , and weave the woof
the winding sheet of edward 's race
give ample room , and verge enough
the characters of hell to trace
ABAB
mark the year , and mark the night
when severn shall re echo with affright
the shrieks of death , thro ’ berkley 's roof that ring
shrieks of an agonizing king
AABB
she wolf of france ,{ 20 } with unrelenting fangs
that tear'st the bowels of thy mangled mate
from thee be born , who o'er thy country hangs
the scourge of heaven . { 21 } what terrors round him wait
ABAB
i love thee when thy swelling buds appear
and one by one their tender leaves unfold
as if they knew that warmer suns were near
nor longer sought to hide from winter 's cold
ABAB
and when with darker growth thy leaves are seen
to veil from view the early robin 's nest
i love to lie beneath thy waving screen
with limbs by summer 's heat and toil oppressed
ABAB
and when the autumn winds have stripped thee bare
and round thee lies the smooth , untrodden snow
when naught is thine that made thee once so fair
i love to watch thy shadowy form below
ABAB
on this foundation fame 's high temple stands
stupendous pile ! not rear 'd by mortal hands
whate'er proud rome or artful greece beheld
or elder babylon , its frame excell 'd
AABB
four faces had the dome , and every face
of various structure , but of equal grace
four brazen gates , on columns lifted high
salute the different quarters of the sky
AABB
here fabled chiefs in darker ages born
or worthies old , whom arms or arts adorn
who cities raised , or tamed a monstrous race
the walls in venerable order grace
AABB
earth has not anything to show more fair
dull would be he of soul who could pass by
a sight so touching in its majesty
this city now doth , like a garment , wear
ABBA
the beauty of the morning ; silent , bare
ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples lie
open unto the fields , and to the sky
all bright and glittering in the smokeless air
ABBA
never did sun more beautifully steep
in his first splendour , valley , rock , or hill
ne'er saw i , never felt , a calm so deep
the river glideth at his own sweet will
ABAB
i speak , fair licia , what my torments be
but then my speech too partial do i find
for hardly words can with those thoughts agree
those thoughts that swarm in such a troubled mind
ABAB
then do i vow my tongue shall never speak
nor tell my grief that in my heart doth lie
but cannon like , i then surcharged do break
and so my silence worse than speech i try
ABAB
thus speech or none , they both do breed my care
i live dismayed , and kill my heart with grief
in all respects my case alike doth fare
to him that wants , and dare not ask relief
ABAB
shout , for a mighty victory is won
on british ground the invaders are laid low
the breath of heaven has drifted them like snow
and left them lying in the silent sun
ABBA
never to rise again !— the work is done
come forth , ye old men , now in peaceful show
and greet your sons ! drums beat and trumpets blow
make merry , wives ! ye little children , stun
ABBA
your grandame 's ears with pleasure of your noise
clap , infants , clap your hands ! divine must be
that triumph , when the very worst , the pain
and even the prospect of our brethren slain
AABB
clarkson ! it was an obstinate hill to climb
how toilsome , nay how dire it was , by thee
is known ,— by none , perhaps , so feelingly
but thou , who , starting in thy fervent prime
ABBA
didst first lead forth this pilgrimage sublime
hast heard the constant voice its charge repeat
which , out of thy young heart 's oracular seat
first roused thee .— o true yoke fellow of time
ABBA
with unabating effort , see , the palm
is won , and by all nations shall be worn
the bloody writing is for ever torn
and thou henceforth shalt have a good man 's calm
ABBA
that day , to great achilles son resign 'd
hermione , the fairest of her kind
was sent to crown the long protracted joy
espoused before the final doom of troy
AABB
with steeds and gilded cars , a gorgeous train
attend the nymphs to phthia 's distant reign
meanwhile at home , to megapentha 's bed
the virgin choir alector 's daughter led
AABB
brave megapenthas from a stolen amour
to great atrides ’ age his handmaid bore
to helen 's bed the gods alone assign
hermione , to extend the regal line
AABB
italia ! thou art fallen , though with sheen
of battle spears thy clamorous armies stride
from the north alps to the sicilian tide
ay ! fallen , though the nations hail thee queen
ABBA
because rich gold in every town is seen
and on thy sapphire lake in tossing pride
of wind filled vans thy myriad galleys ride
beneath one flag of red and white and green
ABBA
o fair and strong ! o strong and fair in vain
look southward where rome 's desecrated town
lies mourning for her god anointed king
look heaven ward ! shall god allow this thing
AABB
i see gray teachers ,— on their work intent
their lavished lives , in endless labor spent
had closed at last in age and penury wrecked
martyrs , not burned , but frozen in neglect
AABB
save for the generous hands that stretched in aid
of worn out servants left to die half paid
ah , many a year will pass , i thought , ere we
such kindly forethought shall rejoice to see
AABB
monarchs are mindful of the sacred debt
that cold republics hasten to forget
i see the priest ,— if such a name he bears
who without pride his sacred vestment wears
AABB
the sex inclined to follow this advice
about receipts however they were not nice
the entertainment greatly was admired
and pure devotion all their bosoms fired
AABB
a glass of cordial some apart received
good cheer was given , may be well believed
ten youthful dames brisk friar fripart took
gay , airy , and engaging ev'ry look
AABB
who paid with pleasure all the monk could wish
some had fifteen :— some twelve to taste their dish
good friar rock had twenty for his share
and gave such satisfaction to the fair
AABB
how soon hath time , the subtle thief of youth
stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year
my hasting days fly on with full career
but my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th
ABBA
perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth
that i to manhood am arrived so near
and inward ripeness doth much less appear
that some more timely happy spirits endu'th
ABBA
our love is not a fading , earthly flower
its wing è d seed dropped down from paradise
and , nursed by day and night , by sun and shower
doth momently to fresher beauty rise
ABAB
to us the leafless autumn is not bare
nor winter 's rattling boughs lack lusty green
our summer hearts make summer 's fulness , where
no leaf , or bud , or blossom may be seen
ABAB
for nature 's life in love 's deep life doth lie
love ,— whose forgetfulness is beauty 's death
whose mystic key these cells of thou and i
into the infinite freedom openeth
ABAB
one of my wishes is that those dark trees
so old and firm they scarcely show the breeze
were not , as ‘ twere , the merest mask of gloom
but stretched away unto the edge of doom
AABB
i should not be withheld but that some day
into their vastness i should steal away
fearless of ever finding open land
or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand
AABB
i do not see why i should e'er turn back
or those should not set forth upon my track
to overtake me , who should miss me here
and long to know if still i held them dear
AABB
if to admire , were to commend my praise
might then both thee , thy work and merit raise
but , as it is ( the child of ignorance
and utter stranger to all ayr of france
AABB
how can i speak of thy great pains , but err
since they can only judge that can confer
behold ! the reverend shade of bartus stands
before my thought and ( in thy right ) commands
AABB
that to the world i publish , for him , this
bartus doth with thy english now were his
so well in that are his inventions wrought
as his will now be the translation thought
AABB
beside the fruitfull shore of muddie nile
upon a sunnie banke outstretched lay
in monstrous length , a mightie crocodile
that , cram 'd with guiltles blood and greedie pray
ABAB
of wretched people travailing that way
thought all things lesse than his disdainfull pride
i saw a little bird , cal 'd tedula
the least of thousands which on earth abide
ABAB
that forst this hideous beast to open wide
the greisly gates of his devouring hell
and let him feede , as nature doth provide
upon his iawes , that with blacke venime swell
ABAB
that god forbid , that made me first your slave
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
or at your hand th ’ account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
ABAB
o let me suffer ( being at your beck
th ’ imprisoned absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each check
without accusing you of injury
ABAB
be where you list , your charter is so strong
that you your self may privilage your time
to what you will , to you it doth belong
your self to pardon of self doing crime
ABAB
whose are the gilded tents that crowd the way
where all was waste and silent yesterday
this city of war which , in a few short hours
hath sprung up here , as if the magic powers
AABB
princely pavilions screened by many a fold
of crimson cloth and topt with balls of gold
steeds with their housings of rich silver spun
their chains and poitrels glittering in the sun
AABB
pride of the sister realm so long our own
we claim with her that spotless fame of thine
white as her snow and fragrant as her pine
ours was thy birthplace , but in every zone
ABBA
some wreath of song thy liberal hand has thrown
breathes perfume from its blossoms , that entwine
where'er the dewdrops fall , the sunbeams shine
on life 's long path with tangled cares o'ergrown
ABBA
can art thy truthful counterfeit command
the silver haloed features , tranquil , mild
soften the lips of bronze as when they smiled
give warmth and pressure to the marble hand
ABBA
england , i stand on thy imperial ground
not all a stranger ; as thy bugles blow
i feel within my blood old battles flow
the blood whose ancient founts in thee are found
ABBA
still surging dark against the christian bound
wide islam presses ; well its peoples know
thy heights that watch them wandering below
i think how lucknow heard their gathering sound
ABBA
i turn and meet the cruel turbaned face
england , ‘ tis sweet to be so much thy son
i feel the conqueror in my blood and race
last night trafalgar awed me , and to day
ABAB
to them zorobabel , on themes like these
“ seek ye the monarch of mankind to please
“ to wine superior or to power 's strong arms
“ be mine to sing resistless woman 's charms
AABB
“ to him victorious in the rival lays
“ shall just darius give the meed of praise
“ the purple robe his honor 'd frame shall fold
“ the beverage sparkle in his cup of gold
AABB
“ a golden couch support his bed of rest
“ the chain of honor grace his favor 'd breast
“ his the soft turban , his the car 's array
“ o'er babylon 's high wall to wheel its way
AABB
howbeit i know not whether as he slept
a voice from out the depth of dream upleapt
and whispered in his ear ; or whether he
grew to the knowledge blindly , as a tree
AABB
waxes from bloom to fruitage , knowing not
the manner of its growth : but this i wot
that rising from that sleep beside the spring
the prince had knowledge of a certain thing
AABB
whereof he had not wist until that hour
to wit , that two contending spirits had power
over his spirit , ruling him with sway
altern ; as ‘ twere dominion now of day
AABB
from the beginning good and fair are one
but men the beauty from the truth will part
and , though the truth is ever beauty 's heart
after the beauty will , short breathed , run
ABBA
and the indwelling truth deny and shun
therefore , in cottage , synagogue , and mart
thy thoughts came forth in common speech , not art
with voice and eye , in jewish babylon
ABBA
thou taughtest — not with pen or carved stone
nor in thy hand the trembling wires didst take
thou of the truth not less than all wouldst make
for truth 's sake even her forms thou didst disown
ABBA
“ thus when young hercules with firm disdain
braved the soft smiles of pleasure 's harlot train
to valiant toils his forceful limbs assign 'd
and gave to virtue all his mighty mind
AABB
495 fierce achelous rush 'd from mountain caves
o'er sad etolia pour 'd his wasteful waves
o'er lowing vales and bleating pastures roll 'd
swept her red vineyards , and her glebes of gold
AABB
mined all her towns , uptore her rooted woods
500 and famine danced upon the shining floods
the youthful hero seized his curled crest
and dash 'd with lifted club the watery pest
AABB
gone are the sensuous stars , and manifold
clear sunbeams burst upon the front of night
ten thousand swords of azure and of gold
give darkness to the dark and welcome light
ABAB
across the night of ages strike the gleams
and leading on the gilded host appears
an old man writing in a book of dreams
and telling tales of lovers for the years
ABAB
still troilus hears a voice that whispers , stay
in nature 's garden what a mad rout sings
let 's hear these motley pilgrims wile away
the tedious hours with stories of old things
ABAB
a smile is curving o'er her creamy cheek
her bosom swells with all a lover 's joy
when love receives a message that the coy
young love god made a strong and true heart speak
ABBA
from far off lands ; and like a mountain peak
that loses in one avalanche its cloy
of ice and snow , so doth her breast employ
its hidden store of blushes ; and they wreak
ABBA
destruction , as they crush my aching heart
destruction , wild , relentless , and as sure
as the poor alpine hamlet 's ; and no art
can hide my agony , no herb can cure
ABAB
chaos , of old , was god 's dominion
‘ twas his belov è d child , his own first born
and he was ag è d ere the thought of morn
shook the sheer steeps of black oblivion
ABBA
then all the works of darkness being done
through countless æ ons hopelessly forlorn
out to the very utmost verge and bourn
god at the last , reluctant , made the sun
ABBA
he loved his darkness still , for it was old
he grieved to see his eldest child take flight
and when his fiat lux the death knell tolled
as the doomed darkness backward by him rolled
AABB
wait for the morning ! ah ! we wait indeed
for daylight , we who toss about through stress
of vacant armed desires and emptiness
of all the warm , warm touches that we need
ABBA
and the warm kisses upon which we feed
our famished lips in fancy ! may god bless
the starved lips of us with but one caress
warm as the yearning blood our poor hearts bleed
ABBA
a wild prayer —! bite thy pillow , praying so
toss this side , and whirl that , and moan for dawn
let the clock 's seconds dribble out their woe
and time be drained of sorrow ! long ago
AABB
and spirits , mingling with the living then
thrill 'd fearful voices with the cries of men
all flying furious , grinning deep despair
shaped dismal shadows on the troubled air
AABB
red lightning shot its flashes as they came
and passing clouds seem 'd kindling into flame
and strong and stronger came the sulphury smell
with demons following in the breath of hell
AABB
behold ! the tabernacle of god 's will
this woman 's form enshrineth . what is this
more glorious than all our age long bliss
which shines within the shadow of her sill
ABBA
how shall we lift this strangeness which doth fill
her human heart to breaking ,— we who miss
in our immortal joy , the enlight'ning kiss
of sorrow 's bitter lips whence comforts thrill
ABBA
how shall we sing to her of joys to come
to her who bears upon her breast the sum
of death 's dread gloom and heaven 's undying light
lean close , ah , close , about her from above
AABB
if that one care had our two hearts possessed
or you once ( felt ) what i long suffer è d
then should thy heart accuse in my heart 's stead
the rigour of itself for mine unrest
ABBA
then should thine arm upon my shoulder rest
and weight of grief sway down thy troubled head
then should thy tears upon my sheet be shed
and then thy heart should pant upon my breast
ABBA
but when that other cares thy heart do seize
alas , what succour gain i then by this
but double grief for thine and mine unease
yet when thou see'st thy hurts to wound my heart
ABAB
spit in my face , you jews , and pierce my side
buffet and scoff , scourge and crucify me
for i have sinned , and sinned , and only he
who could do no iniquity hath died
ABBA
but by my death cannot be satisfied
my sins , which pass the jews ’ impiety
they killed once an inglorious man , but i
crucify him daily , being now glorified
ABBA
“ ‘ to jove ( with stern regard the god replies
and all the offended synod of the skies
just hecatombs with due devotion slain
thy guilt absolved , a prosperous voyage gain
AABB
to the firm sanction of thy fate attend
an exile thou , nor cheering face of friend
nor sight of natal shore , nor regal dome
shalt yet enjoy , but still art doom 'd to roam
AABB
once more the nile , who from the secret source
of jove 's high seat descends with sweepy force
must view his billows white beneath thy oar
and altars blaze along his sanguine shore
AABB
my delia hath the waters of mine eyes
the ready handmaids on her grace t'attend
that never fail to ebb , but ever rise
for to their flow she never grants an end
ABAB
the ocean never did attend more duly
upon his sovereign 's course , the night 's pale queen
nor paid the impost of his waves more truly
than mine unto her cruelty hath been
ABAB
like memnon 's rock , touched with the rising sun
which yields a sound and echoes forth a voice
but when it 's drowned in western seas is done
and drowsy like leaves off to make a noise
ABAB
so i , my love , enlightened with your shine
a poet 's skill within my soul i shroud
not rude like that which finer wits decline
but such as muses to the best allowed
ABAB
but when your figure and your shape is gone
i speechless am like as i was before
or if i write , my verse is filled with moan
and blurred with tears by falling in such store
ABAB
when night first spread her curtain o'er the deep
firm based beneath the waves the lighthouse tower
rose to the clouds , and mariners once more
blest the bright gleam that o'er them ward would keep
ABBA
when rose the moon , the sea lay all asleep
it 's dreaming waves enfolded by the shore
and founded on the rock , of iron its door
the beacon flashed its light across the deep
ABBA
then rose the storm and lashed the waves until
they roared like wounded lions , and there raved
the elemental forces , shock on shock
and all the great sea 's batteries worked their will
ABBA
if in the spirit glows no spark divine
if soulless dust return to dust again
if , after life , but death and dark remain
then it were well to make the moment thine
ABBA
bacchante steeping soul and sense in wine
in lotus lulling languors , fond desires
that heat the heart with fierce , unhallowed fires
till pleasure , circe like , transform us into swine
ABBA
but if some subtler spirit thrill our clay
some god like flame illume this fleeting dust
promethean fire snatched from the olympian height
then must we choose the nobler , higher way
ABBA
for rich with spoils of many a conquer 'd land
all arts and artists theseus could command
who sold for hire , or wrought for better fame
the master painters , and the carvers came
AABB
so rose within the compass of the year
an age 's work , a glorious theatre
then o'er its eastern gate was raised above
a temple , sacred to the queen of love
AABB
and , like a chorus to the words of grace
the ancient fakir , sitting in his place
motionless as an idol and as grim
in the pavilion akbar built for him
AABB
under the court yard trees , ( for he was wise
knew menu 's laws , and through his close shut eyes
saw things far off , and as an open book
into the thoughts of other men could look
AABB
began , half chant , half howling , to rehearse
the fragment of a holy vedic verse
and thus it ran : “ he who all things forgives
conquers himself and all things else , and lives
AABB
“ andromache ! my soul ’ s far better part
why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart
no hostile hand can antedate my doom
till fate condemns me to the silent tomb
AABB
fix ’ d is the term to all the race of earth
and such the hard condition of our birth
no force can then resist , no flight can save
all sink alike , the fearful and the brave
AABB
weary of love , my thoughts of love complained
till reason told them there was no such power
and bade me view fair beauty 's richest flower
to see if there a naked boy remained
ABBA
dear , to thine eyes , eyes that my soul hath pained
thoughts turned them back in that unhappy hour
to see if love kept there his royal bower
for if not there , then no place him contained
ABBA
there was he not , nor boy , nor golden bow
yet as thou turned thy chaste fair eye aside
a flame of fire did from thine eyelids go
which burnt my heart through my sore wounded side
ABAB
at length the awful revelation came
crushing at once his pride of birth and name
the hopes his yearning bosom forward cast
and the ancestral glories of the past
AABB
all fell together , crumbling in disgrace
a turret rent from battlement to base
his daughters talking in the dead of night
in their own chamber , and without a light
AABB
listening , as he was wont , he overheard
and learned the dreadful secret , word by word
and hurrying from his castle , with a cry
he raised his hands to the unpitying sky
AABB
events are on the stage in act display 'd
or by narration , if unseen , convey 'd
cold is the tale distilling thro ’ the ear
filling the soul with less dismay and fear
AABB
than where spectators view , like standers by
the deed submitted to the faithful eye
yet force not on the stage , to wound the sight
asks that should pass within , and shun the light
AABB
many there are the eye should ne'er behold
but touching eloquence in time unfold
ne pueros coram populo medea trucidet
aut humana palam coquat exta nefarius atreus
AABB
followed no pause — to g í w enough was said
nor rest , nor taste of food , his speed delayed
and when arrived , where z á bul 's bowers exhale
ambrosial sweets and scent the balmy gale
AABB
the sentinel 's loud voice in rustem 's ear
announced a messenger from persia , near
the chief himself amidst his warriors stood
dispensing honours to the brave and good
AABB
and soon as g í w had joined the martial ring
( the sacred envoy of the persian king
he , with becoming loyalty inspired
asked what the monarch , what the state required
AABB
since we must sleep the endless sleep at last
since life 's grim juggernaut ‘ neath ruthless wheels
crushes the heart ; since age like winter steals
on youth 's fair flowered fields with blighting blast
ABBA
then to the gods our doubts and fears be cast
enough of sorrow ! joyance is our due
gather the roses ! spurn th ’ envenomed rue
fling to the waiting winds the pallid past
ABBA
steep thee in mellow moods and dear desires
pluck love 's flame hearted flower ere it dies
cull nectared kisses sweet as morning 's breath
warm chastity at passion 's purple fires
ABBA
“ poor maiden ! ” thought the youth , “ if thou wert sent
“ with thy soft lute and beauty 's blandishment
“ to wake unholy wishes in this heart
“ or tempt its truth , thou little know'st the art
AABB
“ for tho ’ thy lips should sweetly counsel wrong
“ those vestal eyes would disavow its song
“ but thou hast breathed such purity , thy lay
“ returns so fondly to youth 's virtuous day
AABB
“ and leads thy soul — if e'er it wandered thence
“ so gently back to its first innocence
“ that i would sooner stop the unchained dove
“ when swift returning to its home of love
AABB
at length he said :— i know not what to do
undressing , by myself , i can n't pursue
shall i your valet call ? rejoined the fair
on no account , said he , with looks of care
AABB
i would not have you in my chamber seen
nor thought that here , by night , a girl had been
your caution is enough , the belle replied
myself between the wall and bed i 'll hide
AABB
‘ twill what you fear prevent , and ills avoid
but bolt the door : you 'll then be not annoyed
let no one come ; for once i 'll do my best
and as your valet act till you 're undressed
AABB
had she not been so excellently fair
my muse had never mourned in lines of woe
but i did too inestimable weigh her
and that 's the cause i now lament me so
ABAB
yet grieve i not because i must grieve ever
and yet , alas , waste tears away , in vain
i am resolv è d truly to pers è ver
though she persisteth in her old disdain
ABAB
iii . heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate
all but the page prescribed , their present state
from brutes what men , from men what spirits know
or who could suffer being here below
AABB
the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day
had he thy reason , would he skip and play
pleased to the last , he crops the flowery food
and licks the hand just raised to shed his blood
AABB
oh blindness to the future ! kindly given
that each may fill the circle mark 'd by heaven
who sees with equal eye , as god of all
a hero perish , or a sparrow fall
AABB
much have i traveled in the realms of gold
and many goodly states and kingdoms seen
round many western islands have i been
which bards in fealty to apollo hold
ABBA
oft of one wide expanse had i been told
that deep brow 'd homer ruled as his demesne
yet did i never breathe its pure serene
till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold
ABBA
then felt i like some watcher of the skies
when a new planet swims into his ken
or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes
he star 'd at the pacific — and all his men
ABAB
fly , some kind harbinger , to grasmere dale
say that we come , and come by this day 's light
fly upon swiftest wing round field and height
but chiefly let one cottage hear the tale
ABBA
there let a mystery of joy prevail
the kitten frolic , like a gamesome sprite
and rover whine , as at a second sight
of near approaching good that shall not fail
ABBA
and from that infant 's face let joy appear
yea , let our mary 's one companion child
that hath her six weeks ’ solitude beguiled
with intimations manifold and dear
ABBA
go now , my friend , drink in with all your eyes
bronze , silver , marble , gems , and tyrian dyes
feel pride when speaking in the sight of rome
go early out to ‘ change and late come home
AABB
for fear your income drop beneath the rate
that comes to mutus from his wife 's estate
and ( shame and scandal !) , though his line is new
you give the pas to him , not he to you
AABB
whate'er is buried mounts at last to light
while things get hid in turn that once looked bright
so when agrippa 's mall and appius ’ way
have watched your well known figure day by day
AABB
how can i then return in happy plight
that am debarred the benefit of rest
when day 's oppression is not eased by night
but day by night and night by day oppressed
ABAB
and each ( though enemies to either 's reign
do in consent shake hands to torture me
the one by toil , the other to complain
how far i toil , still farther off from thee
ABAB
i tell the day to please him thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
so flatter i the swart complexioned night
when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even
ABAB
were i the poet laureate of the fairies
who in a rose leaf finds too broad a page
or could i , like your beautiful canaries
sing with free heart and happy , in a cage
ABAB
perhaps i might within this little space
( as in some eastern tale , by magic power
a giant is imprisoned in a flower
have told you something with a poet 's grace
ABBA
but i need wider limits , ampler scope
a world of freedom for a world of passion
and even then , the glory of my hope
would not be uttered in its stateliest fashion
ABAB
from beauteous windsor 's high and storied halls
where edward 's chiefs start from the glowing walls
to my low cot , from ivory beds of state
pleased i return , unenvious of the great
AABB
so the bee ranges o'er the varied scenes
of corn , of heaths , of fallows , and of greens
pervades the thicket , soars above the hill
or murmurs to the meadow 's murmuring rill
AABB
now haunts old hollowed oaks , deserted cells
now seeks the low vale lily 's silver bells
sips the warm fragrance of the greenhouse bowers
and tastes the myrtle and the citron flowers
AABB
mild arch of promise ! on the evening sky
thou shinest fair with many a lovely ray
each in the other melting . much mine eye
delights to linger on thee ; for the day
ABAB
changeful and many weather 'd , seem 'd to smile
flashing brief splendor thro ’ its clouds awhile
that deepen 'd dark anon and fell in rain
but pleasant is it now to pause , and view
AABB
being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours , and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
ABAB
nor dare i chide the world without end hour
whilst i ( my sovereign ) watch the clock for you
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
ABAB
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be , or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are , how happy you make those
ABAB
him , while he spoke , with smiles calypso eyed
and gently grasp 'd his hand , and thus replied
“ this shows thee , friend , by old experience taught
and learn 'd in all the wiles of human thought
AABB
how prone to doubt , how cautious , are the wise
but hear , o earth , and hear , ye sacred skies
and thou , o styx ! whose formidable floods
glide through the shades , and bind the attesting gods
AABB
no form 'd design , no meditated end
lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend
kind the persuasion , and sincere my aim
the same my practice , were my fate the same
AABB
by night close bolted in the bagnio 's gloom
think how they ponder on their dreadful doom
recal the tender sire , the weeping bride
the home , far sunder 'd by a waste of tide
AABB
brood all the ties that once endear 'd them there
but now , strung stronger , edge their keen despair
till here a fouler fiend arrests their pace
plague , with his burning breath and bloated face
AABB
with saffron eyes that thro the dungeon shine
and the black tumors bursting from the groin
stalks o'er the slave ; who , cowering on the sod
shrinks from the demon and invokes his god
AABB
the lightfoot lackey that runs post by death
bearing the letters which contain our end
the busy advocate that sells his breath
denouncing worst to him , is most his friend
ABAB
o dear , this care no interest holds in me
but holy care , the guardian of thy fair
thine honour 's champion , and thy virtue 's fee
the zeal which thee from barbarous times shall bear
ABAB
lo , the poor indian ! whose untutor 'd mind
sees god in clouds , or hears him in the wind
his soul , proud science never taught to stray
far as the solar walk , or milky way
AABB
where slaves once more their native land behold
no fiends torment , no christians thirst for gold
to be , contents his natural desire
he asks no angel 's wing , no seraph 's fire
AABB
yet all its varied charms , forever free
from task and tribute , labor yields to thee
no more , when april sheds her fitful rain
the sower 's hand shall cast its flying grain
AABB
no more , when autumn strews the flaming leaves
the reaper 's band shall gird its yellow sheaves
for thee alike the circling seasons flow
till the first blossoms heave the latest snow
AABB
in the stiff clod below the whirling drifts
in the loose soil the springing herbage lifts
in the hot dust beneath the parching weeds
life 's withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds
AABB
go from me . yet i feel that i shall stand
henceforward in thy shadow . nevermore
alone upon the threshold of my door
of individual life , i shall command
ABBA
the uses of my soul , nor lift my hand
serenely in the sunshine as before
without the sense of that which i forbore
thy touch upon the palm . the widest land
ABBA
doom takes to part us , leaves thy heart in mine
with pulses that beat double . what i do
and what i dream include thee , as the wine
must taste of its own grapes . and when i sue
ABAB
the husband , while the holy pastor spoke
appeared to grumble and his stars invoke
the wife was in a rage , and ‘ gan to scold
said she to peter , wretch that i behold
AABB
thou'lt be through life a prey to pain and grief
come not to me and bray and hope relief
the worthy pastor would have us procured
the means that might much comfort have ensured
AABB
can he deserve such treatment to receive
good mister john this goose i now would leave
and ev'ry morning , while he gathers fruits
or plants , herbs , cabbages , and various roots
AABB
i must not think of thee ; and , tired yet strong
i shun the thought that lurks in all delight
the thought of thee — and in the blue heaven 's height
and in the dearest passage of a song
ABBA
oh , just beyond the fairest thoughts that throng
this breast the thought of thee waits , hidden yet bright
but it must never , never come in sight
i must stop short of thee the whole day long
ABBA
but when sleep comes to close each difficult day
when night gives pause to the long watch i keep
and all my bonds i needs must loose apart
must doff my will as raiment laid away
ABBA
fair helen to the scaean portals came
where sat the elders , peers of priamus
thymoetas , hiketaon , panthous
and many another of a noble name
ABBA
famed warriors , now in council more of fame
always above the gates , in converse thus
they chattered like cicalas garrulous
who marking helen , swore “ it is no shame
ABBA
that armed achaean knights , and ilian men
for such a woman 's sake should suffer long
fair as a deathless goddess seemeth she
nay , but aboard the red prowed ships again
ABBA
the knell of whitehead tolls !— his cares are past
the hapless tribute of his purchas 'd lays
his servile , his egyptian tasks of praise
if not sublime his strains , fame justly plac 'd
ABBA
their power above their work .— now , with wide gaze
of much indignant wonder , she surveys
to the life labouring oar assiduous haste
a glowing bard , by every muse embrac 'd
AABB
with eager haste descending on the coast
thro the glad states they march their veteran host
from sea nursed newport file o'er western roads
pitch many a camp , and bridge a hundred floods
AABB
thro hartford plains , on litchfield hills they gleam
wave their white flags o'er hudson 's loaded stream
band after band with delaware 's current pour
shade schuylkill 's wave and elk 's indented shore
AABB
one spirit it is that stirs the fathomless deep
of human minds , that shakes the elms in storm
that sings in passionate music , or on warm
still evenings bosoms forth the tufted sleep
ABBA
of thistle seeds that wait a travelling wind
one spirit shapes the subtle rhythms of thought
and the long thundering seas ; the soul is wrought
of one stuff with the body — matter and mind
ABBA
woven together in so close a mesh
that flowers may blossom into a song , that flesh
may strangely teach the loveliest holiest things
to watching spirits . truth is brought to birth
AABB
delight in your bright eyes my death did breed
as light and glittering weapons babes allure
to play with fire and sword , and so procure
then to be burnt and hurt ere they take heed
ABBA
thy beauty so hath made me burn and bleed
yet shall my ashes and my blood assure
thy beauty 's fame forever to endure
for thy fame 's life from my death doth proceed
ABBA
because my heart to ashes burn è d giveth
life to thy fame , thou right a phoenix art
and like a pelican thy beauty liveth
by sucking blood out of my breast and heart
ABAB
they pass me by like shadows , crowds on crowds
dim ghosts of men , that hover to and fro
hugging their bodies round them like thin shrouds
wherein their souls were buried long ago
ABAB
they trampled on their youth , and faith , and love
they cast their hope of human kind away
with heaven 's clear messages they madly strove
and conquered ,— and their spirits turned to clay
ABAB
lo ! how they wander round the world , their grave
whose ever gaping maw by such is fed
gibbering at living men , and idly rave
‘ we only truly live , but ye are dead
ABAB
“ but if you suffer from a chill attack
or other chance should lay you on your back
you then have one who 'll sit by your bed side
will see the needful remedies applied
AABB
and call in a physician , to restore
your health , and give you to your friends once more
nor wife nor son desires your welfare : all
detest you , neighbours , gossips , great and small
AABB
what marvel if , when wealth 's your one concern
none offers you the love you never earn
nay , would you win the kinsmen nature sends
made ready to your hand , and keep them friends
AABB
amid the florid multitude her face
was like the full moon seen behind the lace
of orchard boughs where clouded blossoms part
when spring shines in the world and in the heart
AABB
as the full moon beams to the ferny floor
of summer woods through flower and foliage pour
so to my being 's innermost recess
flooded the light of so much loveliness
AABB
she held as in a vase of priceless ware
the wine that over arid ways and bare
my youth was the pathetic thirsting for
and where she moved the veil of nature grew
AABB
superb and sole , upon a plumed spray
that o'er the general leafage boldly grew
he summ 'd the woods in song ; or typic drew
the watch of hungry hawks , the lone dismay
ABBA
of languid doves when long their lovers stray
and all birds ’ passion plays that sprinkle dew
at morn in brake or bosky avenue
what e'er birds did or dreamed , this bird could say
ABBA
then down he shot , bounced airily along
the sward , twitched in a grasshopper , made song
midflight , perched , prinked , and to his art again
sweet science , this large riddle read me plain
AABB
are there two things , of all which men possess
that are so like each other and so near
as mutual love seems like to happiness
dear asra , woman beyond utterance dear
ABAB
this love which ever welling at my heart
now in its living fount doth heave and fall
now overflowing pours thro ’ every part
of all my frame , and fills and changes all
ABAB
like vernal waters springing up through snow
this love that seeming great beyond the power
of growth , yet seemeth ever more to grow
could i transmute the whole to one rich dower
ABAB
some say thy fault is youth , some wantonness
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
both grace and faults are loved of more and less
thou mak'st faults graces , that to thee resort
ABAB
as on the finger of a throned queen
the basest jewel will be well esteemed
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated , and for true things deemed
ABAB
how many lambs might the stern wolf betray
if like a lamb he could his looks translate
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
ABAB
o me ! what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight
or if they have , where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
ABAB
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not , then love doth well denote
love 's eye is not so true as all men 's : no
ABAB
how can it ? o how can love 's eye be true
that is so vexed with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
the sun it self sees not , till heaven clears
ABAB
so is it not with me as with that muse
stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
who heaven it self for ornament doth use
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
ABAB
making a couplement of proud compare
with sun and moon , with earth and sea 's rich gems
with april 's first born flowers and all things rare
that heaven 's air in this huge rondure hems
ABAB
o let me true in love but truly write
and then believe me , my love is as fair
as any mother 's child , though not so bright
as those gold candles fixed in heaven 's air
ABAB
and you as well must die , beloved dust
and all your beauty stand you in no stead
this flawless , vital hand , this perfect head
this body of flame and steel , before the gust
ABBA
of death , or under his autumnal frost
shall be as any leaf , be no less dead
than the first leaf that fell ,— this wonder fled
altered , estranged , disintegrated , lost
ABBA
nor shall my love avail you in your hour
in spite of all my love , you will arise
upon that day and wander down the air
obscurely as the unattended flower
ABBA
they say a man ne'er bore such love to man
or , if he did , ‘ twere but a cause for shame
but , speaking so , they their own measure scan
and blot their censure with self blaming blame
ABAB
for , thou being beauty 's best , the best of me
worshipp 'd but beauty 's self and beauty 's worth
my fire and air , my spirit , ador è d thee
unmix 'd with gross compounding of my earth
ABAB
and thou wert best of truth , the first in grace
of all rich gems in virtue 's carcanet
then should i not love thee and give thee place
above all love of sense on woman set
ABAB
i love to rise ere gleams the tardy light
winter 's pale dawn ;— and as warm fires illume
and cheerful tapers shine around the room
thro ’ misty windows bend my musing sight
ABBA
where , round the dusky lawn , the mansions white
with shutters clos 'd , peer faintly thro ’ the gloom
that slow recedes ; while yon grey spires assume
rising from their dark pile , an added height
ABBA
by indistinctness given .— then to decree
the grateful thoughts to god , ere they unfold
to friendship , or the muse , or seek with glee
wisdom 's rich page !— o , hours ! more worth than gold
ABAB
wilt thou love god as he thee ? then digest
my soul ! this wholesome meditation
how god the spirit , by angels waited on
in heaven , doth make his temple in thy breast
ABBA
the father having begot a son most blest
and still begetting , ( for he ne'er begun
hath deigned to choose thee by adoption
co heir to his glory , and sabbath 's endless rest
ABBA
and as a robbed man , which by search doth find
his stol'n stuff sold , must lose or buy ‘ t again
the sun of glory came down and was slain
us , whom he had made , and satan stole , to unbind
ABBA
as in the twilight brown , on hillside bare
useth to go the little shepherd maid
watering some strange fair plant , poorly displayed
ill thriving in unwonted soil and air
ABBA
far from its native springtime 's genial care
so on my ready tongue hath love assayed
in a strange speech to wake new flower and blade
while i of thee , proud yet so debonair
ABBA
sing songs whose sense is to my people lost
yield the fair thames , and the fair arno gain
love willed it so , and i , at others ’ cost
already knew love never willed in vain
ABAB
o true , they have a cause , and woe for us
while still they have a cause too piteous
yet , happy for us when , their cause defined
they walk no longer with a stumbler blind
AABB
and quicken in the virtue of their cause
to think me a poor mouther of old saws
i wait the issue of a battling age
the toilers with your ‘ troughsters ’ now engage
AABB
instructing them , through their acutest sense
how close the dangers of indifference
already have my people shown their worth
more love they light , which folds the love of earth
AABB
‘ my friends , ’ he cried ( and cast a mournful look
around the room , and sigh 'd before he spoke
‘ beneath the weight of threescore years i bend
and , worn with cares , am hastening to my end
AABB
how i have lived , alas ! you know too well
in worldly follies which i blush to tell
but gracious heaven has oped my eyes at last
with due regret i view my vices past
AABB
and , as the precept of the church decrees
will take a wife , and live in holy ease
but since by counsel all things should be done
and many heads are wiser still than one
AABB
two loves i have of comfort and despair
which like two spirits do suggest me still
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman coloured ill
ABAB
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
ABAB
and whether that my angel be turned fiend
suspect i may , yet not directly tell
but being both from me both to each friend
i guess one angel in another 's hell
ABAB
women with child , content ; and old men sleeping
and wet strong ploughlands , scarred for certain grain
and babes that weep , and so forget their weeping
and the young heavens , forgetful after rain
ABAB
and evening hush , broken by homing wings
and song 's nobility and wisdom holy
that live , we dead . i would think of a thousand things
lovely and durable , and taste them slowly
ABAB
what shall i say to you ? what can i say
better than silence is ? when i survey
this throng of faces turned to meet my own
friendly and fair , and yet to me unknown
AABB
transformed the very landscape seems to be
it is the same , yet not the same to me
so many memories crowd upon my brain
so many ghosts are in the wooded plain
AABB
i fain would steal away , with noiseless tread
as from a house where some one lieth dead
i cannot go ;— i pause ;— i hesitate
my feet reluctant linger at the gate
AABB
lady ! where'er you roam , whatever land
woos the bright touches of that artist hand
whether you sketch the valley 's golden meads
where mazy linth his lingering current leads
AABB
enamored catch the mellow hues that sleep
at eve , on meillerie 's immortal steep
or musing o'er the lake , at day 's decline
mark the last shadow on that holy shrine
AABB
where , many a night , the shade of tell complains
of gallia 's triumph and helvetia 's chains
oh ! lay the pencil for a moment by
turn from the canvas that creative eye
AABB
and then with her round , brown arms she pressed
his phantom form to her throbbing breast
and whispered the name , in her happy sleep
of her h ó h é hunter so fair and far
AABB
the little , wizened , mysterious man
with his long locks tossed by the moaning breeze
then a flap of wings , like a thunder bird
and a wailing spirit the sleeper heard
AABB
all day i 've bent my heart beneath the yoke
of goading toil , remembering to forget
to still upon my lips his kiss that woke
me in elysian love one word has broke
AABB
point to the summits where the brave have bled
where every village claims its glorious dead
say , when their bosoms met the bayonet 's shock
their only corselet was the rustic frock
AABB
say , when they mustered to the gathering horn
the titled chieftain curled his lip in scorn
yet , when their leader bade his lines advance
no musket wavered in the lion 's glance
AABB
say , when they fainted in the forced retreat
they tracked the snow drifts with their bleeding feet
yet still their banners , tossing in the blast
bore ever ready , faithful to the last
AABB
once in a dream ( for once i dreamed of you
we stood together in an open field
above our heads two swift winged pigeons wheeled
sporting at ease and courting full in view
ABBA
when loftier still a broadening darkness flew
down swooping , and a ravenous hawk revealed
too weak to fight , too fond to fly , they yield
so farewell life and love and pleasures new
ABBA
then as their plumes fell fluttering to the ground
their snow white plumage flecked with crimson drops
i wept , and thought i turned towards you to weep
but you were gone ; while rustling hedgerow tops
ABAB
‘ tis gross to squander hundreds upon fish
yet pen them cooked within too small a dish
so too it turns the stomach , if there sticks
dirt to the bowl wherein your wine you mix
AABB
or if the servant , who behind you stands
has fouled the beaker with his greasy hands
brooms , dish cloths , saw dust , what a mite they cost
neglect them though , your reputation 's lost
AABB
what ? sweep with dirty broom a floor inlaid
spread unwashed cloths o'er tapestry and brocade
forgetting , sure , the less such things entail
of care and cost , the more the shame to fail
AABB
with that delight the royal captiv 's < 46. 2 > brought
before the throne , to breath his farewell thought
to tel his last tale , and so end with it
which gladly he esteemes a benefit
AABB
when the brave victor , at his great soule dumbe
findes something there fate cannot overcome
cals the chain 'd prince , and by his glory led
first reaches him his crowne , and then his head
AABB
who ne 're ‘ til now thinks himself slave and poor
for though nought else , he had himselfe before
he weepes at this faire chance , nor wil allow
but that the diadem doth brand his brow
AABB
such to the rabble may appear inspir 'd
by coxcombs envy 'd , and by fools admir 'd
i pity madmen who attempt to fly
and raise their airy babel to the sky
AABB
who , arm 'd with gabble , to create a name
design a beauty , and a monster frame
not so the seat of phoebus role , which lay
in ruins buried , and a long decay
AABB
to britany the temple was convey 'd
by natures utmost force , and more than human aid
built from the basis by a noble few
the stately fabrick in perfection view
AABB
the chief hung up :— the princess soon appeared
her spirits presently our champion cheered
the pirate scarcely had her bosom moved
no tears at least a marked affection proved
AABB
but , by her prayers she pardon sought to gain
for some who were not in the conflict slain
consoled the dying , and lamented those
who , by the sword , had closed their book of woes
AABB
then left the place without the least regret
where such adventures and alarms she 'd met
‘ tis said , indeed , she presently forgot
the two gallants who last became her lot
AABB
th ’ expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action , and till action , lust
is perjured , murd'rous , bloody full of blame
savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust
ABAB
enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted , and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallowed bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
ABAB
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had , having , and in quest , to have extreme
a bliss in proof and proved , a very woe
before a joy proposed behind a dream
ABAB
because i oft in dark abstracted guise
seem most alone in greatest company
with dearth of words , or answers quite awry
to them that would make speech of speech arise
ABBA
they deem , and of their doom the rumour flies
that poison foul of bubbling pride doth lie
so in my swelling breast , that only i
fawn on myself , and others do despise
ABBA
yet pride , i think , doth not my soul possess
which looks too oft in his unflattering glass
but one worse fault , ambition , i confess
that makes me oft my best friends overpass
ABAB
the stars die out on avon 's watchful breast
while simple shepherds climb through shadows grey
with beating bosoms up the wrekin 's crest
to see the sun “ dance in ” an easter day
ABAB
whose dawning consummates three centuries
since shakespeare 's death and entrance to the skies
resolved the radiant miracle not to miss
reserved alone to earliest opened eyes
ABAB
we , too , with faces set towards the east
our joyful orison offerings yielding up
keep with our risen lord his pascal feast
from paten blest and consecrated cup
ABAB
the church bells tolled , the chant of monks drew near
loud trumpets stammered forth their notes of fear
a line of torches smoked along the street
there was a stir , a rush , a tramp of feet
AABB
and , with its banners floating in the air
slowly the long procession crossed the square
and , to the statues of the prophets bound
the victims stood , with fagots piled around
AABB
then all the air a blast of trumpets shook
and louder sang the monks with bell and book
and the hidalgo , lofty , stern , and proud
lifted his torch , and , bursting through the crowd
AABB
some foreign writers , some our own despise
the ancients only , or the moderns prize
thus wit , like faith , by each man is applied
to one small sect , and all are damned beside
AABB
meanly they seek the blessing to confine
and force that sun but on a part to shine
which not alone the southern wit sublimes
but ripens spirits in cold northern climes
AABB
which from the first has shone on ages past
enlights the present , and shall warm the last
though each may feel increases and decays
and see now clearer and now darker days
AABB
yet , oh ! believe me , mid this mingled maze
of nature 's beauties , where the fancy strays
from charm to charm , where every floweret 's hue
hath something strange , and every leaf is new
AABB
i never feel a joy so pure and still
so inly felt , as when some brook or hill
or veteran oak , like those remembered well
some mountain echo or some wild flower 's smell
AABB
( for , who can say by what small fairy ties
the memory clings to pleasure as it flies
reminds my heart of many a silvan dream
i once indulged by trent 's inspiring stream
AABB
despised ! rejected by the priest led roar
of the multitude ! the imperial purple flung
about the form the hissing scourge had stung
witnessing naked to the truth it bore
ABBA
true son of father true , i thee adore
even the mocking purple truthful hung
on thy true shoulders , bleeding its folds among
for thou wast king , art king for evermore
ABBA
lackyng my love , i go from place to place
lyke a young fawne that late hath lost the hynd
and seeke each where where last i sawe her face
whose ymage yet i carry fresh in mynd
ABAB
cogitat , ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat
antiphaten , scyllamque , et cum cylope charibdin
nor word for word too faithfully translate
nor leap at once into a narrow strait
AABB
the palid thunderstricken sigh for gain
down an ideal stream they ever float
and sailing on pactolus in a boat
drown soul and sense , while wistfully they strain
ABBA
weak eyes upon the glistering sands that robe
the understream . the wise could he behold
cathedralled caverns of thick ribb è d gold
and branching silvers of the central globe
ABBA
would marvel from so beautiful a sight
how scorn and ruin , pain and hate could flow
but hatred in a gold cave sits below
pleached with her hair , in mail of argent light
ABBA
be my companion under cool arcades
that frame some drowsy street and dazzling square
beyond whose flowers and palm tree promenades
white belfries burn in the blue tropic air
ABAB
lie near me in dim forests where the croon
of wood doves sounds and moss banked water flows
or musing late till the midsummer moon
breaks through some ruined abbey 's empty rose
ABAB
methinks i hear the thoughtful reader ask
“ why was the man , at once , not ta'en to task
why did the other men not take a part
with that poor boy , and show a feeling heart
AABB
i am informed they all enjoyed the joke
not one reproachful word they ever spoke
i blush to think that any of my trade
should of such monsters ever be afraid
AABB
the very thought still makes my blood to boil
and shuddering , from such thoughts i back recoil
i would have dragged the fiend unto a jail
or had him fastened to a wagon 's tail
AABB
sweet hand , the sweet but cruel bow thou art
from whence at me five ivory arrows fly
so with five wounds at once i wounded lie
bearing my breast the print of every dart
ABBA
saint francis had the like , yet felt no smart
where i in living torments never die
his wounds were in his hands and feet ; where i
all these five helpless wounds feel in my heart
ABBA
now , as saint francis , if a saint am i
the bow that shot these shafts a relic is
i mean the hand , which is the reason why
so many for devotion thee would kiss
ABAB
i served my sentence — a bitter pill
some fellows should take who never will
and then i decided to go “ out west
concludin ’ ‘ twould suit my health the best
AABB
where , how i prospered , i never could tell
but fortune seemed to like me well
an ’ somehow every vein i struck
was always bubbling over with luck
AABB
an ’ , better than that , i was steady an ’ true
an ’ put my good resolutions through
but i wrote to a trusty old neighbor , an ’ said
“ you tell ‘ em , old fellow , that i am dead
AABB
in all my wanderings round this world of care
in all my griefs — and god has given my share
i still had hopes , my latest hours to crown
amidst these humble bowers to lay me down
AABB
to husband out life 's taper at the close
and keep the flame from wasting by repose
i still had hopes , for pride attends us still
amidst the swains to show my book learned skill
AABB
around my fire an evening group to draw
and tell of all i felt , and all i saw
and , as an hare whom hounds and horns pursue
pants to the place from whence at first she flew
AABB
look in my face ; my name is might have been
i am also called no more , too late , farewell
unto thine ear i hold the dead sea shell
cast up thy life 's foam fretted feet between
ABBA
unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen
which had life 's form and love 's , but by my spell
is now a shaken shadow intolerable
of ultimate things unuttered the frail screen
ABBA
mark me , how still i am ! but should there dart
one moment through thy soul the soft surprise
of that winged peace which lulls the breath of sighs
then shalt thou see me smile , and turn apart
ABBA
the poetry of earth is never dead
when all the birds are faint with the hot sun
and hide in cooling trees , a voice will run
from hedge to hedge about the new mown mead
ABBA
that is the grasshopper 's — he takes the lead
in summer luxury ,— he has never done
with his delights , for when tired out with fun
he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed
ABBA
the poetry of earth is ceasing never
on a lone winter evening , when the frost
has wrought a silence , from the stove there shrills
the cricket 's song , in warmth increasing ever
ABBA
when first sweet phillis , whom i must adore
gan with her beauties bless our wond'ring sky
the son of rhea , from their fatal store
made all the gods to grace her majesty
ABAB
the warrior mars bequeathed her fierce disdain
venus her smile , and phoebe all her fair
python his voice , and ceres all her grain
the morn her locks and fingers did repair
ABAB
another to the witnesses ’ roll call
hath answered , “ here i am ! ” and so stept out
with willingness crowned everywhere about
not the head only , but the body all
ABBA
in one great nimbus of obedient fall
his heart 's blood dashing in the face of doubt
love 's last victorious stand amid the rout
— silence is left , and the untasted gall
ABBA
no chariot with ramping steeds of fire
the father sent to fetch his man child home
his brother only called , “ my gordon , come
and like a dove to heaven he did aspire
ABBA
when lost francesca sobbed her broken tale
of love and sin and boundless agony
while that wan spirit by her side did wail
and bite his lips for utter misery
ABAB
the grief which could not speak , nor hear , nor see
so tender grew the superhuman face
of one who listened , that a mighty trace
of superhuman woe gave way , and pale
ABBA
hope , like the hyaena , coming to be old
alters his shape , is turned into despair
pity my hoary hopes , maid of clear mould
think not that frowns can ever make thee fair
ABAB
what harm is it to kiss , to laugh , to play
beauty 's no blossom , if it be not used
sweet dalliance keeps the wrinkles long away
repentance follows them that have refused
ABAB
to bring you to the knowledge of your good
i seek , i sue . o try and then believe
each image can be chaste that 's carved of wood
you show you live , when men you do relieve
ABAB
is it a reed that 's shaken by the wind
or what is it that ye go forth to see
lords , lawyers , statesmen , squires of low degree
men known , and men unknown , sick , lame , and blind
ABBA
post forward all , like creatures of one kind
with first fruit offerings crowd to bend the knee
in france , before the new born majesty
‘ tis ever thus . ye men of prostrate mind
ABBA
a seemly reverence may be paid to power
but that 's a loyal virtue , never sown
in haste , nor springing with a transient shower
when truth , when sense , when liberty were flown
ABAB
trained in the holy art whose lifted shield
wards off the darts a never slumbering foe
by hearth and wayside lurking , waits to throw
oppression taught his helpful arm to wield
ABBA
the slayer 's weapon : on the murderous field
the fiery bolt he challenged laid him low
seeking its noblest victim . even so
the charter of a nation must be sealed
ABBA
the healer 's brow the hero 's honors crowned
from lowliest duty called to loftiest deed
living , the oak leaf wreath his temples bound
dying , the conqueror 's laurel was his meed
ABAB
i pray you not , leuconoe , to pore
with unpermitted eyes on what may be
appointed by the gods for you and me
nor on chaldean figures any more
ABBA
‘ t were infinitely better to implore
the present only : — whether jove decree
more winters yet to come , or whether he
make even this , whose hard , wave eaten shore
ABBA
‘ fore long the trees begin to show belief
the maple crimsons to a coral reef
then saffern swarms swing off from all the willers
so plump they look like yaller caterpillars
AABB
then gray hossches'nuts leetle hands unfold
softer ‘ n a baby 's be at three days old
thet 's robin redbreast 's almanick ; he knows
thet arter this ther 's only blossom snows
AABB
take all my loves , my love , yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love , my love , that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine , before thou hadst this more
ABAB
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear love 's wrong , than hate 's known injury
ABAB
i lift mine eyes , and all the windows blaze
with forms of saints and holy men who died
here martyred and hereafter glorified
and the great rose upon its leaves displays
ABBA
and then the organ sounds , and unseen choirs
sing the old latin hymns of peace and love
and benedictions of the holy ghost
and the melodious bells among the spires
ABBA
with lilies woven and with wet woodbine
till once they sought the bright aetnaean flowers
and their glad mistress fled from summer hours
with hades , far from olive , corn , and vine
ABBA
and they have sought her all the wide world through
till many years , and wisdom , and much wrong
have filled and changed their song , and o'er the blue
rings deadly sweet the magic of the song
ABAB
unchanged within , to see all changed without
is a blank lot and hard to bear , no doubt
yet why at others ’ wanings should'st thou fret
then only might'st thou feel a just regret
AABB
hadst thou withheld thy love or hid thy light
in selfish forethought of neglect and slight
o wiselier then , from feeble yearnings freed
while , and on whom , thou may'st — shine on ! nor heed
AABB
whether the object by reflected light
return thy radiance or absorb it quite
and though thou notest from thy safe recess
old friends burn dim , like lamps in noisome air
AABB
heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate
all but the page prescribed , their present state
from brutes what men , from men what spirits know
or who could suffer being here below
AABB
the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day
had he thy reason , would he skip and play
pleased to the last , he crops the flowery food
and licks the hand just raised to shed his blood
AABB
oh , blindness to the future ! kindly given
that each may fill the circle marked by heaven
who sees with equal eye , as god of all
a hero perish , or a sparrow fall
AABB
of whist or cribbage mark th ’ amusing game
the partners changing , but the sport the same
else would the gamester 's anxious ardour cool
dull every deal , and stagnant every pool
AABB
— yet must one man , with one unceasing wife
play the long rubber of connubial life
yes ! human laws , and laws esteemed divine
the generous passion straighten and confine
AABB
and , as a stream , when art constrains its course
pours its fierce torrent with augmented force
so passion , narrowed to one channel small
unlike the former ,— does not flow at all
AABB
when , lo ! a spectre rose , whose index hand
held forth the virtue of the dreadful wand
his beaver 'd brow a birchen garland wears
dropping with infants ’ blood and mothers ’ tears
AABB
o'er every rein a shuddering horror runs
eton and winton shake through all their sons
all flesh is humbled , westminster 's bold race
shrink , and confess the genius of the place
AABB
“ hear , every trojan , lycian , dardan band
all famed in war , and dreadful hand to hand
be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won
your great forefathers ’ glories , and your own
AABB
heard ye the voice of jove ? success and fame
await on troy , on greece eternal shame
in vain they skulk behind their boasted wall
weak bulwarks ; destined by this arm to fall
AABB
high o ’ er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound
and pass victorious o ’ er the levell ’ d mound
soon as before yon hollow ships we stand
fight each with flames , and toss the blazing brand
AABB
‘ now turn to different sports ( the goddess cries
and learn , my sons , the wondrous power of noise
to move , to raise , to ravish every heart
with shakspeare 's nature , or with jonson 's art
AABB
let others aim : ‘ tis yours to shake the soul
with thunder rumbling from the mustard bowl
with horns and trumpets now to madness swell
now sink in sorrows with a tolling bell
AABB
such happy arts attention can command
when fancy flags , and sense is at a stand
improve we these . three cat calls be the bribe
of him whose chattering shames the monkey tribe
AABB
thy soul perchance in amaranth fields at ease
thought not to hear the sound on earth revived
of summer music from the spring derived
when thy song sucked the flower of flowering trees
ABBA
but thine was not the chance of every day
time , after many a darkling hour , grew sunny
and light between the clouds ere sunset swam
laughing , and kissed their darkness all away
ABBA
here one is happy if the fickle crowd
his name the threefold honor has allowed
and there another , if into his stores
comes what is swept from libyan threshing floors
AABB
he who delights to till his father 's lands
and grasps the delving hoe with willing hands
can never to attalic offers hark
or cut the myrtoan sea with cyprian bark
AABB
the merchant , timorous of afric 's breeze
when fiercely struggling with icarian seas
praises the restful quiet of his home
nor wishes from the peaceful fields to roam
AABB
waves trough , rebound , and furious boil again
like plunging monsters rising underneath
who at the top curl up a shaggy mane
a moment catching at a surer breath
ABAB
then plunging headlong down and down , and on
each following whirls the shadow of the last
and other monsters rise when those are gone
crest their fringed waves , plunge onward and are past
ABAB
the chill air comes around me oceanly
from bank to bank the waterstrife is spread
strange birds like snowspots oer the whizzing sea
hang where the wild duck hurried past and fled
ABAB
flowers i would bring if flowers could make thee fairer
and music , if the muse were dear to thee
( for loving these would make thee love the bearer
but sweetest songs forget their melody
ABAB
being one day at my window all alone
so manie strange things happened me to see
as much it grieveth me to thinke thereon
at my right hand a hynde appear 'd to mee
ABAB
so faire as mote the greatest god delite
two eager dogs did her pursue in chace
of which the one was blacke , the other white
with deadly force so in their cruell race
ABAB
with clytia he no longer was received
than while he was a man of wealth believed
balls , concerts , op'ras , tournaments , and plays
expensive dresses , all engaging ways
AABB
were used to captivate this lady fair
while scarcely one around but in despair
wife , widow , maid , his fond affection sought
to gain him , ev'ry wily art was brought
AABB
but all in vain :— by passion overpow'red
the belle , whose conduct others would have soured
to him appeared a goddess full of charms
superior e'en to helen , in his arms
AABB
go thou into thy closet ; shut thy door
and pray to him in secret : he will hear
but think not thou , by one wild bound , to clear
the numberless ascensions , more and more
ABBA
of starry stairs that must be climbed , before
thou comest to the father 's likeness near
and bendest down to kiss the feet so dear
that , step by step , their mounting flights passed o'er
ABBA
be thou content if on thy weary need
there falls a sense of showers and of the spring
a hope that makes it possible to fling
sickness aside , and go and do the deed
ABBA
one day the doctor found the bottle full
and , being thirsty , took a vigorous pull
put back the “ elixir ” where ‘ t was always found
and had old dobbin saddled and brought round
AABB
— you know those old time rhubarb colored nags
that carried doctors and their saddle bags
sagacious beasts ! they stopped at every place
where blinds were shut — knew every patient 's case
AABB
looked up and thought — the baby 's in a fit
that wo n't last long — he 'll soon be through with it
but shook their heads before the knockered door
where some old lady told the story o'er
AABB
xii . “ pellucid forms ! whose crystal bosoms show
the shine of welfare , or the shade of woe
who with soft lips salute returning spring
450 and hail the zephyr quivering on his wing
AABB
or watch , untired , the wintery clouds , and share
with streaming eyes my vegetable care
go , shove the dim mist from the mountain 's brow
chase the white fog , which floods the vale below
AABB
455 melt the thick snows , that linger on the lands
and catch the hailstones in your little hands
guard the coy blossom from the pelting shower
and dash the rimy spangles from the bower
AABB
when to the public school compelled to go
what novel scenes did on my senses flow
there in each breast each active power dilates
which ‘ broils whole nations , and convulses states
AABB
their reigns , by turns alternate , love and hate
ambition burns , and factious rebels prate
and in a smaller range , a smaller sphere
the dark deformities of man appear
AABB
yet there the gentler virtues kindred claim
there friendship lights her pure untainted flame
there mild benevolence delights to dwell
and sweet contentment rests without her cell
AABB
some infidel , i fancy , in my ear
would whisper probabilities , i fear
are rather wanting to support the fact
however perfectly gallants may act
AABB
to gain a heart requires full many a day
if more be requisite i cannot say
‘ tis not my plan to dupe or young or old
but such to me , howe'er the tale is told
AABB
and ariosto never truth forsakes
yet , if at ev'ry step a writer takes
he 's closely question 'd as to time and place
he ne'er can end his work with easy grace
AABB
‘ andromache ! my soul 's far better part
why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart
no hostile hand can antedate my doom
till fate condemns me to the silent tomb
AABB
fixed is the term to all the race of earth
and such the hard condition of our birth
no force can then resist , no flight can save
all sink alike , the fearful and the brave
AABB
the squire had wished his trusty man , no doubt
had not , at cudgelling , been quite so stout
but since he showed himself so true a friend
and with his actions could such prudence blend
AABB
the master fully pardoned what he knew
and quickly to his wife in bed he flew
when he related every thing that passed
were we , cried he , a hundred years to last
AABB
my lovely dear , we ne'er on earth could find
a man so faithful , and so well inclined
i 'd have him take within our town a wife
and you and i 'll regard him during life
AABB
here learning , too , shall rear unnumbered domes
here shakspeares — tassos — find more happy homes
here homer 's fire , and virgil 's polished grace
a sacred charm shall give to many a place
AABB
she spake no more ;— or i too much opprest
by wondrous visions , needed welcome rest
and when i waked , the day had now unfurled
his rosy banners o'er the laughing world
AABB
an arid daylight shines along the beach
dried to a grey monotony of tone
and stranded jelly fish melt soft upon
the sun baked pebbles , far beyond their reach
ABBA
sparkles a wet , reviving sea . here bleach
the skeletons of fishes , every bone
polished and stark , like traceries of stone
the joints and knuckles hardened each to each
ABBA
and they are dead while waiting for the sea
the moon pursuing sea , to come again
their hearts are blown away on the hot breeze
only the shells and stones can wait to be
ABBA
there was a cry of terror in the hall
of peru 's monarch , and a startling call
but no reply — iola sure was gone
yet none knew why or whither she had flown
AABB
her inca father put his crown aside
and filled the temple with loud prayer — a tide
of lamentation rolled along the fair
and blooming realm ; heaven wore a dim despair
AABB
she ne'er was found ; but how or when she died
none knew ; by her own hand ; or if she cried
vainly , in wild beasts ’ clutch ;— but ne'er before
din wail so wild resound along the shore
AABB
this is the golden book of spirit and sense
the holy writ of beauty ; he that wrought
made it with dreams and faultless words and thought
that seeks and finds and loses in the dense
ABBA
dim air of life that beauty 's excellence
wherewith love makes one hour of life distraught
and all hours after follow and find not aught
here is that height of all love 's eminence
ABBA
where man may breathe but for a breathing space
and feel his soul burn as an altar fire
to the unknown god of unachieved desire
and from the middle mystery of the place
ABBA
instead of parchment , writing on the soul
high thoughts and aspirations , being so
thine own ideal ; poet and poem , lo
one indivisible ; thou didst reach thy goal
ABBA
god made my lady lovely to behold
above the painter 's dream he set her face
and wrought her body in divinest grace
he touched the brown hair with a sense of gold
ABBA
and in the perfect form he did enfold
what was alone as perfect , the sweet heart
knowledge most rare to her he did impart
and filled with love and worship all her days
ABBA
and then god thought him how it would be well
to give her music , and to love he said
“ bring thou some minstrel now that he may tell
how fair and sweet a thing my hands have made
ABAB
like as the seeded field greene grasse first showes
then from greene grasse into a stalke doth spring
and from a stalke into an eare forth growes
which eare the frutefull graine doth shortly bring
ABAB
so grew the romane empire by degree
till that barbarian hands it quite did spill
and left of it but these olde markes to see
of which all passers by doo somewhat pill
ABAB
two voices are there ; one is of the sea
one of the mountains ; each a mighty voice
in both from age to age thou didst rejoice
they were thy chosen music , liberty
ABBA
there came a tyrant , and with holy glee
thou fought'st against him ; but hast vainly striven
thou from thy alpine holds at length art driven
where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee
ABBA
of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft
then cleave , o cleave to that which still is left
for , high soul 'd maid , what sorrow would it be
that mountain floods should thunder as before
AABB
the goddess answer 'd : “ father , i obey
and point the wandering traveller his way
well known to me the palace you inquire
for fast beside it dwells my honour 'd sire
AABB
but silent march , nor greet the common train
with question needless , or inquiry vain
a race of ragged mariners are these
unpolish 'd men , and boisterous as their seas
AABB
the native islanders alone their care
and hateful he who breathes a foreign air
these did the ruler of the deep ordain
to build proud navies , and command the main
AABB
the city slept beneath the moonbeam 's glance
her white walls gleaming through the vines of france
and all was hushed , save where the footsteps fell
on some high tower , of midnight sentinel
AABB
but one still watched ; no self encircled woes
chased from his lids the angel of repose
he watched , he wept , for thoughts of bitter years
bowed his dark lashes , wet with burning tears
AABB
his country 's sufferings and her children 's shame
streamed o'er his memory like a forest 's flame
each treasured insult , each remembered wrong
rolled through his heart and kindled into song
AABB
the sister nuns so vigilant had been
one night when darkness overspread the scene
and all was proper mysteries to hide
some words escaped her cell that doubts supplied
AABB
and other matters too were heard around
that in her breviary could not be found
‘ tis her gallant ! said they : he 's clearly caught
alarm pervaded ; swarms were quickly brought
AABB
rage seemed to triumph ; sentinels were placed
the abbess too must know they were disgraced
away they hastened to convey surprise
and , thund'ring at her door , cried , madam rise
AABB
“ ‘ close by , a rock of less enormous height
breaks the wild waves , and forms a dangerous strait
full on its crown a fig 's green branches rise
and shoot a leafy forest to the skies
AABB
beneath , charybdis holds her boisterous reign
‘ midst roaring whirlpools , and absorbs the main
thrice in her gulfs the boiling seas subside
thrice in dire thunders she refunds the tide
AABB
oh , if thy vessel plough the direful waves
when seas retreating roar within her caves
ye perish all ! though he who rules the main
lends his strong aid , his aid he lends in vain
AABB
her gay descent the man perceived afar
wondering he ran to catch the falling star
but so surprised , as none but he can tell
who loved so quickly , and who loved so well
AABB
o'er all his veins the wandering passion burns
he calls her nymph , and every nymph by turns
her form to lovely venus he prefers
or swears that venus must be such as hers
AABB
she , proud to rule , yet strangely framed to tease
neglects his offers while her airs she plays
shoots scornful glances from the bended frown
in brisk disorder trips it up and down
AABB
but be contented when that fell arrest
without all bail shall carry me away
my life hath in this line some interest
which for memorial still with thee shall stay
ABAB
when thou reviewest this , thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee
the earth can have but earth , which is his due
my spirit is thine the better part of me
ABAB
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
the prey of worms , my body being dead
the coward conquest of a wretch 's knife
too base of thee to be remembered
ABAB
oh , cruel liquor ! thou hast millions slain
and still their death throes cry to thee in vain
ten thousand broken hearts may soon be found
in almost every land the world around
AABB
millions of orphans ’ cries thine ears assail
while parents ’ early death they loud bewail
the prisons and asylums which we build
from thy sad victims ’ ranks are chiefly filled
AABB
war 's dreadful ravages are justly blamed
but war with thee deserves not to be named
and still , insatiate monster ! thy dread jaws
are daily filled — being unrestrained by laws
AABB
nor can i not believe but that hereby
great gains are mine : for thus i live remote
from evil speaking ; rancour , never sought
comes to me not ; malignant truth , or lie
ABBA
blessings be with them , and eternal praise
who gave us nobler loves , and nobler cares
the poets , who on earth have made us heirs
of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays
ABBA
in vain he sigh 'd , and oft with tears desired
some reasonable suit might be required
but still the crone was constant to her note
the more he spoke , the more she stretch 'd her throat
AABB
in vain he proffer 'd all his goods , to save
his body destined to that living grave
the liquorish hag rejects the pelf with scorn
and nothing but the man would serve her turn
AABB
not all the wealth of eastern kings , said she
have power to part my plighted love , and me
and , old and ugly as i am , and poor
yet never will i break the faith i swore
AABB
“ mother , ” he said , “ thou askest no great thing
some wretch too bad for death i soon shall find
who round her perfect neck his arms shall wind
she shall be driven from the palace gate
ABBA
where once her crowd of worshippers would wait
from earliest morning till the dew was dry
on chance of seeing her gold gown glancing by
there through the storm of curses shall she go
ABBA
in evil raiment midst the winter snow
or in the summer in rough sheepskins clad
and thus , o mother , shall i make thee glad
remembering all the honour thou hast brought
ABBA
let not the mitre england 's prelate wears
next to the crown whose regal pomp it shares
though low before it courtly christians bow
leave its red mark on younger england 's brow
AABB
we love , we honor , the maternal dame
but let her priesthood wear a modest name
while through the waters of the pilgrim 's bay
a new born mayflower shows her keels the way
AABB
too old grew britain for her mother 's beads
must we be necklaced with her children 's creeds
welcome alike in surplice or in gown
the loyal lieges of the heavenly crown
AABB
take of the first fruits , father , of thy care
wrapped in the fresh leaves of my gratitude
late waked for early gifts ill understood
claiming in all my harvests rightful share
ABBA
whether with song that mounts the joyful air
i praise my god , or , in yet deeper mood
sit dumb because i know a speechless good
needing no voice , but all the soul for prayer
ABBA
thou hast been faithful to my highest need
and i , thy debtor , ever , evermore
shall never feel the grateful burden sore
yet most i thank thee , not for any deed
ABBA
i reached the alps : the soul within me burned
italia , my italia , at thy name
and when from out the mountain 's heart i came
and saw the land for which my life had yearned
ABBA
i laughed as one who some great prize had earned
and musing on the marvel of thy fame
i watched the day , till marked with wounds of flame
the turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned
ABBA
the pine trees waved as waves a woman 's hair
and in the orchards every twining spray
was breaking into flakes of blossoming foam
but when i knew that far away at rome
AABB
disciple of the bright aonian maid
in thy life 's blossom , a resistless spell
amid the wild wood , and irriguous dell
o'er thymy hill , and thro ’ illumin 'd glade
ABBA
led thee , for her thy votive wreaths to braid
where flaunts the musk rose , and the azure bell
nods o'er loquacious brook , or silent well
thus woo 'd her inspirations , their rapt aid
ABBA
liberal she gave ; nor only thro ’ thy strain
breath 'd their pure spirit , while her charms beguil 'd
the languid hours of sorrow , and of pain
but when youth 's tide ran high , and tempting smil 'd
ABAB
seeker of truth !— long hast thou striven to find
this only boon that satisfies the mind
through nature 's stores the treasure hast thou sought
hast traversed all the boundless fields of thought
AABB
questioned the lonely night , the laughing day
the ocean depths , the founts that ceaseless play
old hoary mountains , cliffs , and caverns lone
earth 's secret depths — mysterious , unknown
AABB
he that hath seene a great oke drie and dead
yet clad with reliques of some trophees olde
lifting to heaven her aged hoarie head
whose foote in ground hath left but feeble holde
ABAB
but halfe disbowel 'd lies above the ground
shewing her wreathed rootes , and naked armes
and on her trunke all rotten and unsound
onely supports herselfe for meate of wormes
ABAB
i go from colonnade to colonnade
in streets that dante trod , and past the towers
aslant toward heaven , and listen to the hours
chimed by the bells of choirs where dante prayed
ABBA
they cease ; then lo ! the foot of time seems stayed
five hundred years and more , i find me bowers
where sweet and noble ladies weave them flowers
for one who reads boccaccio in the shade
ABBA
the cowl è d students halt by two and threes
to hear the voice come thrilling through the trees
then tear themselves away to themes more trite
anon i mark the diligent hands that turn
AABB
“ such are the men who , with instinctive dread
whenever freedom lifts her drooping head
make prophet tripods of their office stools
and scare the nurseries and the village schools
AABB
with dire presage of ruin grim and great
a broken union and a foundered state
such are the patriots , self bound to the stake
of office , martyrs for their country 's sake
AABB
who fill themselves the hungry jaws of fate
and by their loss of manhood save the state
in the wide gulf themselves like cortius throw
and test the virtues of cohesive dough
AABB
when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutored youth
unlearned in the world 's false subtleties
ABAB
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best
simply i credit her false speaking tongue
on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
ABAB
but wherefore says she not she is unjust
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o love 's best habit is in seeming trust
and age in love , loves not to have years told
ABAB
i know , indeed , that sons of thine have died
in lissa 's waters , by the mountain side
of aspromonte , on novara 's plain
nor have thy children died for thee in vain
AABB
and yet , methinks , thou hast not drunk this wine
from grapes new crushed of liberty divine
thou hast not followed that immortal star
which leads the people forth to deeds of war
AABB
weary of life , thou liest in silent sleep
as one who marks the lengthening shadows creep
careless of all the hurrying hours that run
mourning some day of glory , for the sun
AABB
a satyr spied a goddess in her bath
unseen of her attendant nymphs ; none knew
forthwith the creature to his fellows drew
and looking backward on the curtained path
ABBA
he strove to tell ; he could but heave a breast
too full , and point to mouth , with failing leers
vainly he danced for speech , he giggled tears
made as if torn in two , as if tight pressed
ABBA
as if cast prone ; then fetching whimpered tunes
for words , flung heel and set his hairy flight
through forest hollows , over rocky height
the green leaves buried him three rounds of moons
ABBA
giddings , far rougher names than thine have grown
smoother than honey on the lips of men
and thou shalt aye be honorably known
as one who bravely used his tongue and pen
ABAB
as best befits a freeman ,— even for those
to whom our law 's unblushing front denies
a right to plead against the lifelong woes
which are the negro 's glimpse of freedom 's skies
ABAB
fear nothing , and hope all things , as the right
alone may do securely ; every hour
the thrones of ignorance and ancient night
lose somewhat of their long usurp è d power
ABAB
rare is the loveliness of slow decay
with youth and beauty all must be desired
but ‘ tis the charm of things long past away
they leave , alone , the light they have inspired
ABAB
the calmness of a picture ; memory now
is the sole life among the ruins grey
and like a phantom in fantastic play
she wanders with rank weeds stuck on her brow
ABBA
over grass hidden caves and turret tops
herself almost as tottering as they
while , to the steps of time , her latest props
fall stone by stone , and in the sun 's hot ray
ABAB
sweet spirits of the beautiful ! where'er ye dwell
whether upon the misty mountain tops
with mantling crags about ye , or in dell
and sunny valley , by the hazel copse
ABAB
wherein the ring dove nestles , or by streams
that wander amid woodlands , with the sheen
of noontide trembling through the leafy screen
down to their mossy banks in fitful gleams
ABBA
that murmur with the linnets and at e'en
sigh with the plaintive nightingale , and oft
mirror your bright eyes in the sparkling dew
circle me ever with your joyous crew
AABB
well , when in summer afternoons you see
men fain to listen , tell them about me
tell them that , born a freedman 's son , possessed
of slender means , i soared beyond my nest
AABB
that so whate'er ' s deducted for my birth
may count as assets on the score of worth
say that i pleased the greatest of my day
then draw my picture ;— prematurely grey
AABB
of little person , fond of sunny ease
lightly provoked , but easy to appease
last , if my age they ask you , let them know
that i was forty four not long ago
AABB
of all the causes which conspire to blind
man 's erring judgment , and misguide the mind
what the weak head with strongest bias rules
is pride , the never failing voice of fools
AABB
whatever nature has in worth denied
she gives in large recruits of needful pride
for as in bodies , thus in souls , we find
what wants in blood and spirits , swell 'd with wind
AABB
pride , where wit fails , steps in to our defence
and fills up all the mighty void of sense
if once right reason drives that cloud away
truth breaks upon us with resistless day
AABB
haunted of beauty , like the marvellous youth
who sang saint agnes ’ eve ! how passing fair
her shapes took color in thy homestead air
how on thy canvas even her dreams were truth
ABBA
teacher i thy lesson was not given in vain
beauty is goodness ; ugliness is sin
art 's place is sacred : nothing foul therein
may crawl or tread with bestial feet profane
ABBA
man rising to the doom that shall not err
which hath most dread : the arouse of all or each
all kindreds of all nations of all speech
or one by one of him and him and her
ABBA
while dust reanimate begins to stir
here , there , beyond , beyond , reach beyond reach
while every wave refashions on the beach
alive or dead in life some seafarer
ABBA
now meeting doth not join or parting part
true meeting and true parting wait till then
when whoso meet are joined for evermore
face answering face and heart at rest in heart
ABBA
said he , we now are in a place retired
unknown to man , ( such spots how oft desired
let 's take advantage of the present hour
no joys , but those of love , are in our pow'r
AABB
all others see withdrawn ! and no one knows
we even live ; perhaps both friends and foes
believe us in the belly of a whale
allow me , lovely princess , to prevail
AABB
bestow your kindness , or , without delay
those charms to mamolin let me convey
yet , why go thither ?— happy you could make
the man , whose constancy no perils shake
AABB
wilt thou love god as he thee ? then digest
my soul ! this wholesome meditation
how god the spirit , by angels waited on
in heaven , doth make his temple in thy breast
ABBA
the father having begot a son most blest
and still begetting , ( for he ne'er begun
hath deigned to choose thee by adoption
co heir to his glory , and sabbath 's endless rest
ABBA
and as a robbed man , which by search doth find
his stol'n stuff sold , must lose or buy ‘ t again
the sun of glory came down and was slain
us , whom he had made , and satan stole , to unbind
ABBA
thy followers too , old europe 's noblest pride
when future gales shall wing them o'er the tide
a ruddier hue and deeper shade shall gain
and stalk , in statelier figures , on the plain
AABB
the sage , the chief , the patriot unconfined
shield the weak world and meliorate mankind
but think not thou , in all the range of man
that different pairs each different cast began
AABB
no ; cast by fortune on a frowning coast
which neither groves nor happy valleys boast
where other cares than those the muse relates
and other shepherds dwell with other mates
AABB
by such examples taught , i paint the cot
as truth will paint it and as bards will not
nor you , ye poor , of lettered scorn complain
to you the smoothest song is smooth in vain
AABB
o'ercome by labour and bowed down by time
feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme
can poets soothe you , when you pine for bread
by winding myrtles round your ruined shed
AABB
nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance
to watch the gate was warlike nisus ’ chance
his father hyrtacus of noble blood
his mother was a huntress of the wood
AABB
and sent him to the wars . well could he bear
his lance in fight , and dart the flying spear
but better skill 'd unerring shafts to send
beside him stood euryalus , his friend
AABB
euryalus , than whom the trojan host
no fairer face , or sweeter air , could boast
scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun
one was their care , and their delight was one
AABB
look , when the rose to deep vermilion hue
adds that sweet odour gracious nature gives
when his proud glory gladdens every view
and no base worm within his beauties lives
ABAB
we nothing question of what sex it be
nor ask more of it than that it should lend
his lovely gaze for ravish 'd eye to see
and on the blessed air his fragrance spend
ABAB
instant the queen , observant of the king
commands her train a spacious vase to bring
the spacious vase with ample streams suffice
heap the high wood , and bid the flames arise
AABB
and adding a rich dress inwrought with art
a gift expressive of her bounteous heart
thus spoke to ithacus : “ to guard with bands
insolvable these gifts , thy care demands
AABB
when i consider life and its few years
a wisp of fog betwixt us and the sun
a call to battle , and the battle done
ere the last echo dies within our ears
ABBA
a rose choked in the grass ; an hour of fears
the gusts that past a darkening shore do beat
the burst of music down an unlistening street
i wonder at the idleness of tears
ABBA
bumptious and vain and proud he shoulders up
and would be something if he knew but how
to any man on earth he will not stoop
but cracks of work , of horses and of plough
ABAB
so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse
ABAB
thine eyes , that taught the dumb on high to sing
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
have added feathers to the learned 's wing
and given grace a double majesty
ABAB
yet be most proud of that which i compile
whose influence is thine , and born of thee
in others ’ works thou dost but mend the style
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
ABAB
you secret vales , you solitary fields
you shores forsaken and you sounding rocks
if ever groaning heart hath made you yield
or words half spoke that sense in prison locks
ABAB
then ‘ mongst night shadows whisper out my death
that when myself hath sealed my lips from speaking
each tell tale echo with a weeping breath
may both record my truth and true love 's breaking
ABAB
you pretty flowers that smile for summer 's sake
pull in your heads before my wat'ry eyes
do turn the meadows to a standing lake
by whose untimely floods your glory dies
ABAB
the social laws from insult to protect
to cherish peace , to cultivate respect
the rich from wanton cruelty restrain
to smooth the bed of penury and pain
AABB
the hapless vagrant to his rest restore
the maze of fraud , the haunts of theft explore
the thoughtless maiden , when subdued by art
to aid , and bring her rover to her heart
AABB
wild riot 's voice with dignity to quell
forbid unpeaceful passions to rebel
wrest from revenge the meditated harm
for this fair justice raised her sacred arm
AABB
if all the flowers of all the fields on earth
by wonder working summer were made one
its fragrance were not sweeter in the sun
its treasure house of leaves were not more worth
ABBA
than those wherefrom thy light of musing mirth
shone , till each leaf whereon thy pen would run
breathed life , and all its breath was benison
beloved beyond all names of english birth
ABBA
more dear than mightier memories ; gentlest name
that ever clothed itself with flower sweet fame
or linked itself with loftiest names of old
by right and might of loving ; i , that am
AABB
my song i do but hold for you in trust
i ask you but to blossom from my dust
when you have compassed all weak i began
diviner poet , and ah ! diviner man
AABB
the man at feud with the perduring child
in you before song 's altar nobly reconciled
from the wise heavens i half shall smile to see
how little a world , which owned you , needed me
AABB
if , while you keep the vigils of the night
for your wild tears make darkness all too bright
some lone orb through your lonely window peeps
as it played lover over your sweet sleeps
AABB
i served my sentence — a bitter pill
some fellows should take who never will
and then i decided to go “ out west
concludin ’ ‘ twould suit my health the best
AABB
where , how i prospered , i never could tell
but fortune seemed to like me well
an ’ somehow every vein i struck
was always bubbling over with luck
AABB
an ’ better than that , i was steady an ’ true
an ’ put my good resolutions through
but i wrote to a trusty old neighbour , an ’ said
“ you tell ‘ em , old fellow , that i am dead
AABB
“ ‘ tis now the dead of night , ” and i will go
to where the brook soft murmuring glides along
in the still wood ; yet does the plaintive song
of philomela through the welkin flow
ABBA
and while pale cynthia carelessly doth throw
her dewy beams the verdant boughs among
will sit beneath some spreading oak tree strong
and intermingle with the streams my woe
ABBA
hush 'd in deep silence every gentle breeze
no mortal breath disturbs the awful gloom
cold , chilling dewdrops trickle down the trees
and every flower withholds its rich perfume
ABAB
strong son of fergus , with thy latest breath
thou hast lent a joy unto the funeral knell
welcoming with thy whispered “ all is well
the awful aspect of the angel death
ABBA
as , strong in life , thou couldst not brook to shun
the heat and burthen of the fiery day
fronting defeat with stalwart undismay
and wearing meekly honours stoutly won
ABBA
pure lips , pure hands , pure heart were thine , as aye
erin demanded from her bards of old
and , therefore , on thy harpstrings of pure gold
has waked once more her high heroic lay
ABBA
not in our dreams , not even in our dreams
may we return to that sweet land of youth
that home of hope , of innocence , and truth
which as we farther roam but fairer seems
ABBA
in that dim shadowy world , where the soul strays
when she has laid her mortal charge to rest
we oft behold far future hours and days
but ne'er live o'er the past , the happiest
ABAB
against that time ( if ever that time come
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
called to that audit by advised respects
ABAB
to know thee is all wisdom , and old age
is but to know thee : dimly we behold thee
athwart the veils of evil which enfold thee
we beat upon our aching hearts with rage
ABBA
we cry for thee : we deem the world thy tomb
as dwellers in lone planets look upon
the mighty disk of their majestic sun
hallowed in awful chasms of wheeling gloom
ABBA
come down , o christ , and help me ! reach thy hand
for i am drowning in a stormier sea
than simon on thy lake of galilee
the wine of life is spilt upon the sand
ABBA
my heart is as some famine murdered land
whence all good things have perished utterly
and well i know my soul in hell must lie
if i this night before god 's throne should stand
ABBA
‘ he sleeps perchance , or rideth to the chase
like baal , when his prophets howled that name
from morn to noon on carmel 's smitten height
nay , peace , i shall behold , before the night
AABB
is it not strange ? a year ago to day
with scarce a thought beyond the hum drum round
i did my decent job and earned my pay
was averagely happy , i 'll be bound
ABAB
ay , in my little groove i was content
seeing my life run smoothly to the end
with prosy days in stolid labour spent
and jolly nights , a pipe , a glass , a friend
ABAB
in god 's good time a hearth fire 's cosy gleam
a wife and kids , and all a fellow needs
when presto ! like a bubble goes my dream
i leap upon the stage of splendid deeds
ABAB
i 'd be concern 'd in no litigious jarr
belov 'd by , all not vainly popular
whate'er assistance i had power to bring
t'oblige my country , or to serve my king
AABB
whene'er they call 'd , i 'd readily afford
my tongue , my pen , my counsel , or my sword
law suit i 'd shun with as much studious care
as i wou 'd dens where hungry lyons are
AABB
an rather put up injuries than be
a plague to him , who 'd be a plague to me
i value quiet at a price too great
to give for my revenge so dear a rate
AABB
father of nations ! help of the feeble hand
strength of the strong ! to whom the nations kneel
stay and destroyer , at whose just command
earth 's kingdoms tremble and her empires reel
ABAB
who dost the low uplift , the small make great
and dost abase the ignorantly proud
of our scant people mould a mighty state
to the strong , stern ,— to thee in meekness bowed
ABAB
father of unity , make this people one
weld , interfuse them in the patriot 's flame
whose forging on thine anvil was begun
in blood late shed to purge the common shame
ABAB
o lady fair , whose honoured name doth grace
green vale and noble ford of rheno 's stream
of all worth void the man i surely deem
whom thy fair soul enamoureth not apace
ABBA
when softly self revealed to time and space
by actions sweet with which thy will doth teem
and fair gifts that love 's bow and arrows seem
but are the flowers that crown thy perfect race
ABBA
when thou dost lightsome talk or gladsome sing
a power to draw the hill trees , rooted hard
the doors of eyes and ears let that man keep
who knows himself unworthy thy regard
ABAB
rid of the world 's injustice , and his pain
he rests at last beneath god 's veil of blue
taken from life when life and love were new
the youngest of the martyrs here is lain
ABBA
fair as sebastian , and as early slain
no cypress shades his grave , no funeral yew
but gentle violets weeping with the dew
weave on his bones an ever blossoming chain
ABBA
o proudest heart that broke for misery
o sweetest lips since those of mitylene
o poet painter of our english land
thy name was writ in water — it shall stand
AABB
sweet bird , that sing'st away the early hours
of winters past or coming , void of care
well pleased with delights which present are
fair seasons , budding sprays , sweet smelling flowers
ABBA
to rocks , to springs , to rills , from leafy bowers
thou thy creator 's goodness dost declare
and what dear gifts on thee he did not spare
a stain to human sense in sin that lowers
ABBA
what soul can be so sick , which by thy songs
attired in sweetness , sweetly is not driven
quite to forget earth 's turmoils , spites , and wrongs
and lift a reverend eye and thought to heaven
ABAB
carved from the block or cast in clinging mould
will grateful memory fondly try her best
the mortal vesture from decay to wrest
his look shall greet us , calm , but ah , how cold
ABBA
no breath can stir the brazen drapery 's fold
no throb can heave the statue 's stony breast
“ he is not here , but risen , ” will stand confest
in all we miss , in all our eyes behold
ABBA
how nature loved him ! on his placid brow
thought 's ample dome , she set the sacred sign
that marks the priesthood of her holiest shrine
nor asked a leaflet from the laurel 's bough
ABBA
nymph of the downward smile , and sidelong glance
in what diviner moments of the day
art thou most lovely ? when gone far astray
into the labyrinths of sweet utterance
ABBA
or when serenely wand'ring in a trance
of sober thought ? or when starting away
with careless robe , to meet the morning ray
thou spar'st the flowers in thy mazy dance
ABBA
haply ‘ tis when thy ruby lips part sweetly
and so remain , because thou listenest
but thou to please wert nurtured so completely
that i can never tell what mood is best
ABAB
that as thou hast served us hath rewarded thee
blessed , who throweth against war 's boundary stone
thy warrior brood , and breaketh bone by bone
misrule thy son , thy daughter tyranny
ABBA
that landmark shalt thou not remove for shame
but sitting down there in a widow 's weed
wail ; for what fruit is now of thy red fame
have thy sons too and daughters learnt indeed
ABAB
against my love shall be as i am now
with time 's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn
when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
with lines and wrinkles , when his youthful morn
ABAB
hath travelled on to age 's steepy night
and all those beauties whereof now he 's king
are vanishing , or vanished out of sight
stealing away the treasure of his spring
ABAB
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding age 's cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet love 's beauty , though my lover 's life
ABAB
t. since , in plain terms , ‘ tis poverty you fear
and riches are your aim , attend and hear
suppose a thrush or other dainty placed
at your disposal , for your private taste
AABB
speed it to some great house , all gems and gold
where means are ample , and their master old
your choicest apples , ripe and full of juice
and whatsoe'er your garden may produce
AABB
before they 're offered at the lares ’ shrine
give them to your rich friend , as more divine
be he a branded slave , forsworn , distained
with brother 's blood , in short , a rogue ingrained
AABB
o gracious mother , whose benignant breast
wakes us to life , and lulls us all to rest
how thy sweet features , kind to every clime
mock with their smile the wrinkled front of time
AABB
we stain thy flowers ,— they blossom o'er the dead
we rend thy bosom , and it gives us bread
o'er the red field that trampling strife has torn
waves the green plumage of thy tasselled corn
AABB
our maddening conflicts sear thy fairest plain
still thy soft answer is the growing grain
yet , o our mother , while uncounted charms
steal round our hearts in thine embracing arms
AABB
how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which like a canker in the fragrant rose
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
ABAB
that tongue that tells the story of thy days
( making lascivious comments on thy sport
cannot dispraise , but in a kind of praise
naming thy name , blesses an ill report
ABAB
o what a mansion have those vices got
which for their habitation chose out thee
where beauty 's veil doth cover every blot
and all things turns to fair , that eyes can see
ABAB
sierra 's poet ! high and pure thy muse
enthroned doth sit amongst the stars and snows
and from thy harp olympian music flows
of glacier heights and gleaming mountain dews
ABBA
of western sea and burning sunset hues
and we who look up — who on the plain repose
and catch faint glimpses of the mount that throws
athwart thy poet sight diviner views
ABBA
and not alone from starry shrine is strung
thy lyre , but timed to gentler lay
that sings of children , motherhood and home
and lifts our hearts and lives to sweeter day
ABAB
fayre ye be sure , but cruell and unkind
as is a tygre , that with greedinesse
hunts after bloud ; when he by chance doth find
a feeble beast , doth felly him oppresse
ABAB
i shall forget you presently , my dear
so make the most of this , your little day
your little month , your little half a year
ere i forget , or die , or move away
ABAB
and we are done forever ; by and by
i shall forget you , as i said , but now
if you entreat me with your loveliest lie
i will protest you with my favorite vow
ABAB
i would indeed that love were longer lived
and oaths were not so brittle as they are
but so it is , and nature has contrived
to struggle on without a break thus far
ABAB
the thridde day , this marchant up aryseth
and on his nedes sadly him avyseth
and up in to his countour hous goth he
to rekene with him self , as wel may be
AABB
of thilke yeer , how that it with him stood
and how that he despended hadde his good
and if that he encressed were or noon
his bokes and his bagges many oon
AABB
men see their god , an immanence divine
smile through the curve of flesh or moulded clay
in bare ploughed lands that go sloping away
to meet the sky in one clean exquisite line
ABBA
out of the short seen dawns of ecstasy
they draw new beauty , whence new thoughts are born
and in their turn conceive , as grains of corn
germ and create new life and endlessly
ABBA
shall live creating . out of earthly seeds
springs the aerial flower . one spirit proceeds
through change , the same in body and in soul
the spirit of life and love that triumphs still
AABB
spit in my face , you jews , and pierce my side
buffet and scoff , scourge and crucify me
for i have sinned , and sinned , and only he
who could do no iniquity hath died
ABBA
but by my death cannot be satisfied
my sins , which pass the jews ’ impiety
they killed once an inglorious man , but i
crucify him daily , being now glorified
ABBA
ye too , dim watchfires of some darkling hour
whose fame forlorn time saves not nor proclaims
for ever , but forgetfulness defames
and darkness and the shadow of death devour
ABBA
lift up ye too your light , put forth your power
let the far twilight feel your soft small flames
and smile , albeit night name not even their names
ghost by ghost passing , flower blown down on flower
ABBA
that sweet tongued shadow , like a star 's that passed
singing , and light was from its darkness cast
to paint the face of painting fair with praise
and that wherein forefigured smiles the pure
AABB
now powerful but inconstant in its course
the tempest varies with uncertain force
like doleful wailings on the lonely waste
solemn and dreary sounds the weaning blast
AABB
exhausted gusts recoiling growl away
and , wak 'd anew , return with feebler sway
save where between the ridgy mountains pent
the fierce imprison 'd current strives for vent
AABB
with hollow howl , and lamentation deep
then rushes o'er the plain with partial sweep
a parting gust o'erscours the weary land
and lowly growls along the distant strand
AABB
make me thy lyre , ev'n as the forest is
what if my leaves are falling like its own
the tumult of thy mighty harmonies
will take from both a deep autumnal tone
ABAB
these plaintive verse , the posts of my desire
which haste for succour to her slow regard
bear not report of any slender fire
forging a grief to win a fame 's reward
ABAB
nor are my passions limned for outward hue
for that no colours can depaint my sorrows
delia herself , and all the world may view
best in my face where cares have tilled deep furrows
ABAB
no bays i seek to deck my mourning brow
o clear eyed rector of the holy hill
my humble accents bear the olive bough
of intercession but to move her will
ABAB
the glorious image of the makers beautie
my soverayne saynt , the idoll of my thought
dare not henceforth , above the bounds of dewtie
t'accuse of pride , or rashly blame for ought
ABAB
stay mee with saffron , underneath me set
full banks of roses , beds of violet
refresh mee with the choicest fruit , and spread
the whitest lillies round about my head
AABB
for the delay of the seene pow ’ re divine
in sacred flames , consumes this breast of mine
yee daughters of that holy citie , yee
yee sisters ! i , ’ tis i , that humbly pray
AABB
o , i , intreat you , by each hind , and roe
that straying o ’ re the tops of hills doe goe
yee stock of ancient isaac , yee that move
with nimble foot through lebanus sweet grove
AABB
the sister nuns so vigilant had been
one night when darkness overspread the scene
and all was proper mysteries to hide
some words escaped her cell that doubts supplied
AABB
and other matters too were heard around
that in her breviary could not be found
‘ tis her gallant ! said they : he 's clearly caught
alarm pervaded ; swarms were quickly brought
AABB
rage seemed to triumph ; sentinels were placed
the abbess too must know they were disgraced
away they hastened to convey surprise
and , thund'ring at her door , cried , madam rise
AABB
there was a touching paleness on her face
which chased her smiles , but such sweet union made
of pensive majesty and heavenly grace
as if a passing cloud had veil 'd her with its shade
ABAB
then knew i how the blessed ones above
gaze on each other in their perfect bliss
for never yet was look of mortal love
so pure , so tender , so serene as this
ABAB
the softest glance fond woman ever sent
to him she loved , would cold and rayless be
compared to this , which she divinely bent
earthward , with angel sympathy , on me
ABAB
my angel sister , tho ’ thy lovely form
perish 'd in youth 's gay morning , yet is mine
this precious ringlet !— still the soft hairs shine
still glow the nut brown tints , all bright and warm
ABBA
with sunny gleam !— alas ! each kindred charm
vanish 'd long since ; deep in the silent shrine
wither 'd to shapeless dust !— and of their grace
memory alone retains the faithful trace
AABB
dear lock , had thy sweet owner liv 'd , ere now
time on her brow had faded thee !— my care
screen 'd from the sun and dew thy golden glow
and thus her early beauty dost thou wear
ABAB
thus graced , thus glorified , shall shakspeare crave
the sculptor 's skill , the pageant of the grave
he needs it not — but gratitude demands
this votive offering at his country 's hands
AABB
haply , e'er now , from blissful bowers on high
from some parnassus of the empyreal sky
pleased , o'er this dome the gentle spirit bends
accepts the gift , and hails us as his friends
AABB
yet smiles , perchance , to think when envious time
o'er bust and urn shall bid his ivies climb
when palaces and pyramids shall fall
his page shall triumph — still surviving all
AABB
“ even in a palace , life may be led well
so spoke the imperial sage , purest of men
marcus aurelius . but the stifling den
of common life , where , crowded up pell mell
ABBA
our freedom for a little bread we sell
and drudge under some foolish master 's ken
who rates us if we peer outside our pen
matched with a palace , is not this a hell
ABBA
“ even in a palace ! ” on his truth sincere
who spoke these words no shadow ever came
and when my ill schooled spirit is aflame
some nobler , ampler stage of life to win
ABBA
who lists to see what ever nature , arte
and heaven could doo , o rome , thee let him see
in case thy greatnes he can gesse in harte
by that which but the picture is of thee
ABAB
rome is no more : but if the shade of rome
may of the bodie yeeld a seeming sight
it 's like a corse drawne forth out of the tombe
by magicke skill out of eternall night
ABAB
oh , thou whose melody the heart obeys
thou who can'st all its subject passions move
whose notes to heav'n the list'ning soul can raise
can thrill with pity , or can melt with love
ABAB
happy ! whom nature lent this native charm
whose melting tones can shed with magic power
a sweeter pleasure o'er the social hour
the breast to softness sooth , to virtue warm — but
ABBA
yet more happy ! that thy life as clear
from discord , as thy perfect cadence flows
that tun 'd to sympathy , thy faithful tear
in mild accordance falls for others woes
ABAB
my own beloved , who hast lifted me
from this drear flat of earth where i was thrown
and in betwixt the languid ringlets , blown
a life breath , till the forehead hopefully
ABBA
shines out again , as all the angels see
before thy saving kiss ! my own , my own
who camest to me when the world was gone
and i who looked for only god , found thee
ABBA
i find thee : i am safe , and strong , and glad
as one who stands in dewless asphodel
looks backward on the tedious time he had
in the upper life ... so i , with bosom swell
ABAB
the light of life has faded from thy cause
high priest of heaven and hell and purgatory
thy lips are loud with strains of oldworld story
but the red prey was rent out of thy paws
ABBA
long since : and they that dying brake down thy laws
have with the fires of death enkindled glory
put out the flame that faltered on thy hoary
high altars , waning with the world 's applause
ABBA
this italy was dante 's : bruno died
here : campanella , too sublime for pride
endured thy god 's worst here , and hence went home
and what art thou , that time 's full tide should shrink
AABB
through the hushed street , along the silent plain
the spectral future leads its mourning train
dark with the shadows of uncounted bands
where man 's white lips and woman 's wringing hands
AABB
track the still burden , rolling slow before
that love and kindness can protect no more
the smiling babe that , called to mortal strife
shuts its meek eyes and drops its little life
AABB
the drooping child who prays in vain to live
and pleads for help its parent cannot give
the pride of beauty stricken in its flower
the strength of manhood broken in an hour
AABB
a woman i forswore ; but i will prove
thou being a goddess , i forswore not thee
my vow was earthly , thou a heavenly love
thy grace being gain 'd cures all disgrace in me
ABAB
my vow was breath , and breath a vapour is
then , thou fair sun , that on this earth doth shine
exhale this vapour vow ; in thee it is
if broken , then it is no fault of mine
ABAB
“ sic semper tyrannis ! ” the assassin cried
as lincoln fell . o villain ! who than he
more lived to set both slave and tyrant free
or so enrapt with plans of freedom died
ABBA
that even thy treacherous deed shall glance aside
and do the dead man 's will by land and sea
win bloodless battles , and make that to be
which to his living mandate was denied
ABBA
peace to that gentle heart ! the peace he sought
for all mankind , nor for it dies in vain
rest to the uncrowned king , who , toiling , brought
his bleeding country through that dreadful reign
ABAB
the knightly legend on thy shield betrays
the moral of thy life ; a forecast wise
and that large honor that deceit defies
inspired thy fathers in the elder days
ABBA
who decked thy scutcheon with that sturdy phrase
to be , rather than seem . as eve 's red skies
surpass the morning 's rosy prophecies
thy life to that proud boast its answer pays
ABBA
scorning thy faith and purpose to defend
the ever mutable multitude at last
will hail the power they did not comprehend
thy fame will broaden through the centuries
ABAB
thou art the rock of empire , set mid seas
between the east and west , that god has built
advance thy roman borders where thou wilt
while run thy armies true with his decrees
ABBA
law , justice , liberty ,— great gifts are these
watch that they spread where english blood is spilt
lest , mixt and sullied with his country 's guilt
the soldier 's life stream flow and heaven displease
ABBA
two swords there are : one naked , apt to smite
thy blade of war ; and , battled storied , one
rejoices in the sheath and hides from light
american i am ; would wars were done
ABAB
with shame repulsed , with grief and fury driven
the frantic asius thus accuses heaven
“ in powers immortal who shall now believe
can those too flatter , and can jove deceive
AABB
what man could doubt but troy ’ s victorious power
should humble greece , and this her fatal hour
but like when wasps from hollow crannies drive
to guard the entrance of their common hive
AABB
darkening the rock , while with unwearied wings
they strike the assailants , and infix their stings
a race determined , that to death contend
so fierce these greeks their last retreats defend
AABB
when erst her hand the crust of chaos thirl 'd
and forced from his black breast the bursting world
high swell 'd the huge existence crude and crass
a formless dark impermeated mass
AABB
no light nor heat nor cold nor moist nor dry
but all concocting in their causes lie
millions of periods , such as these her spheres
learn since to measure and to call their years
AABB
she broods the mass ; then into motion brings
and seeks and sorts the principles of things
pours in the attractive and repulsive force
whirls forth her globes in cosmogyral course
AABB
umbrageous woods , green dells , and mountains high
and bright cascades , and wide cerulean seas
slumbering , or snow wreathed by the freshening breeze
and isles like motionless clouds upon the sky
ABBA
in silent summer noons , late charmed mine eye
until my soul was stirred like wind touched trees
and passionate love and speechless ecstasies
up raised the thoughts in spiritual depths that lie
ABBA
fair scenes , ye haunt me still ! yet i behold
this sultry city on the level shore
not all unmoved ; for here our fathers bold
won proud historic names in days of yore
ABAB
from records true my legends i rehearse
and string the pearls of wisdom in my verse
that in the glimmering days of life 's decline
its fruits , in wealth and honor , may be mine
AABB
my verse , a structure pointing to the skies
whose solid strength destroying time defies
all praise the noble work , save only those
of impious life , or base malignant foes
AABB
all blest with learning read , and read again
the sovereign smiles , and thus approves my strain
“ richer by far , firdusi , than a mine
of precious gems , is this bright lay of thine
AABB
is it a reed that 's shaken by the wind
or what is it that ye go forth to see
lords , lawyers , statesmen , squires of low degree
men known , and men unknown , sick , lame , and blind
ABBA
post forward all , like creatures of one kind
with first fruit offerings crowd to bend the knee
in france , before the new born majesty
‘ tis ever thus . ye men of prostrate mind
ABBA
a seemly reverence may be paid to power
but that 's a loyal virtue , never sown
in haste , nor springing with a transient shower
when truth , when sense , when liberty were flown
ABAB
x . cease then , nor order imperfection name
our proper bliss depends on what we blame
know thy own point : this kind , this due degree
of blindness , weakness , heav'n bestows on thee
AABB
all nature is but art , unknown to thee
all chance , direction , which thou canst not see
all discord , harmony not understood
all partial evil , universal good
AABB
no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns , and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
ABAB
all men make faults , and even i in this
authorizing thy trespass with compare
my self corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
ABAB
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense
thy adverse party is thy advocate
and ‘ gainst my self a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
ABAB
the crimson panes like blood drops stigmatise
the western floor . the aisles are mute and cold
a rigid fetich in her robe of gold
the virgin of the pillar , with blank eyes
ABBA
enthroned beneath her votive canopies
gathers a meagre remnant to her fold
the rest is solitude ; the church , grown old
stands stark and grey beneath the burning skies
ABBA
well nigh again its mighty framework grows
to be a part of nature 's self , withdrawn
from hot humanity 's impatient woes
the floor is ridged like some rude mountain lawn
ABAB
all childhood , reverence clothed thee , undefined
as for some being of another race
ah , not with it , departing — growing apace
as years did bring me manhood 's loftier mind
ABBA
able to see thy human life behind
the same hid heart , the same revealing face
my own dim contest settling into grace
of sorrow , strife , and victory combined
ABBA
so i beheld my god , in childhood 's morn
a mist , a darkness , great , and far apart
moveless and dim — i scarce could say thou art
my manhood came , of joy and sadness born
ABBA
the sea was sapphire coloured , and the sky
burned like a heated opal through the air
we hoisted sail ; the wind was blowing fair
for the blue lands that to the eastward lie
ABBA
from the steep prow i marked with quickening eye
zakynthos , every olive grove and creek
ithaca 's cliff , lycaon 's snowy peak
and all the flower strewn hills of arcady
ABBA
the flapping of the sail against the mast
the ripple of the water on the side
the ripple of girls ’ laughter at the stern
the only sounds : when ‘ gan the west to burn
AABB
thus the poor ass whose appetite has ne'er
known than the thistle any sweeter fare
thinks all the world eats thistles . thus the clown
the wit and mentor of the country town
AABB
grins through the collar of a horse and thinks
others for pleasure do as he for drinks
though secretly , because unwilling still
in public to attest their lack of skill
AABB
each dunce whose life and mind all follies mar
believes as he is all men living are
his vices theirs , their understandings his
naught that he knows not , all he fancies , is
AABB
homes of our sires , where learning 's temple rose
while vet they struggled with their banded foes
as in the west thy century 's sun descends
one parting gleam its dying radiance lends
AABB
darker and deeper though the shadows fall
from the gray towers on doubting castle 's wall
though pope and pagan re array their hosts
and her new armor youthful science boasts
AABB
truth , for whose altar rose this holy shrine
shall fly for refuge to these bowers of thine
no past shall chain her with its rusted vow
no jew 's phylactery bind her christian brow
AABB
must all of worth be travailled for , and those
life 's brightest stars rise from a troubled sea
must years go by in sad uncertainty
leaving us doubting whose the conquering blows
ABBA
are we or fate the victors ? time which shows
all inner meanings will reveal , but we
shall never know the upshot . ours to be
wasted with longing , shattered in the throes
ABBA
the agonies of splendid dreams , which day
dims from our vision , but each night brings back
we strive to hold their grandeur , and essay
to be the thing we dream . sudden we lack
ABAB
first , most , to thee , my son , i give this book
in which a friend 's and brother 's verses blend
with mine ; for not son only — brother , friend
art thou , through sonship which no veil can brook
ABBA
between the eyes that in each other look
or any shadow ‘ twixt the hearts that tend
still nearer , with divine approach , to end
in love eternal that cannot be shook
ABBA
when all the shakable shall cease to be
with growing hope i greet the coming day
when from thy journey done i welcome thee
who sharest in the names of all the three
AABB
white rounded firmness , and each body alert
with such swift loveliness , that very rest
seemed a poised movement : ... phantoms that impressed
but a faint influence and could bless or hurt
ABBA
a life so sacred , such serene repose
seem 'd heaven itself , till one suggestion rose
that vice should triumph , virtue vice obey
this sprung some doubt of providence 's sway
AABB
down bend the banks , the trees depending grow
and skies beneath with answering colours glow
but if a stone the gentle scene divide
swift ruffling circles curl on every side
AABB
contented evening ; comfortable joys
the snoozing fire , and all the fields are still
tranquil delight , no purpose , and no noise
unless the slow wind flowing round the hill
ABAB
‘ murry ’ ( the kettle ) dozes ; little mouse
is rambling prudently about the floor
there 's lovely conversation in this house
words become princes that were slaves before
ABAB
what a sweet atmosphere for you and me
the people that have been here left behind
oh , but i fear it may turn out to be
built of a dream , erected in the mind
ABAB
science ! true daughter of old time thou art
who alterest all things with thy peering eyes
why preyest thou thus upon the poet 's heart
vulture , whose wings are dull realities
ABAB
how should he love thee ? or how deem thee wise
who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
to seek for treasure in the jewelled skies
albeit he soared with an undaunted wing
ABAB
hast thou not dragged diana from her car
and driven the hamadryad from the wood
to seek a shelter in some happier star
hast thou not torn the naiad from her flood
ABAB
to one who has been long in city pent
‘ tis very sweet to look into the fair
and open face of heaven ,— to breathe a prayer
full in the smile of the blue firmament
ABBA
who is more happy , when , with heart 's content
fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
of wavy grass , and reads a debonair
and gentle tale of love and languishment
ABBA
returning home at evening , with an ear
catching the notes of philomel ,— and eye
watching the sailing cloudlet 's bright career
he mourns that day so soon has glided by
ABAB
so i once thought ! oh , once my very soul
was filled and thrilled with dreaming of that role
life seemed so wonderful ; it held for me
no purpose , no ambition , but to be
AABB
loving and loved . my highest thought of fame
was some day bearing my dear lover 's name
alone , i ofttimes uttered it aloud
or wrote it down , half timid , and all proud
AABB
to see myself lost utterly in him
as some small star might joy in growing dim
when sinking in the sun ; or as the dew
forgetting the brief little life it knew
AABB
hail ! gifted youth , whose passion breathing lay
portrays a mind attuned to noblest themes
a mind , which , wrapt in fancy 's high wrought dreams
to nature 's veriest bounds its daring way
ABBA
can wing : what charms throughout thy pages shine
to win with fairy thrill the melting soul
for though along impassion 'd grandeur roll
yet in full power simplicity is thine
ABBA
proceed , sweet bard ! and the heaven granted fire
of pity , glowing in thy feeling breast
may nought destroy , may nought thy soul divest
of joy — of rapture in the living lyre
ABBA
no other choice belphegor now had got
than — try himself the hymeneal knot
in florence he beheld a certain fair
with charming face and smart engaging air
AABB
of noble birth , but puffed with empty pride
some marks of virtue , though not much beside
for roderick was asked this lofty dame
the father said honesta * ( such her name
AABB
had many eligible offers found
but , ‘ mong the num'rous band that hovered round
perhaps his daughter , rod'rick ' s suit might take
though he should wish for time the choice to make
AABB
new england ! proudly may thy children claim
their honored birthright by its humblest name
cold are thy skies , but , ever fresh and clear
no rank malaria stains thine atmosphere
AABB
no fungous weeds invade thy scanty soil
scarred by the ploughshares of unslumbering toil
long may the doctrines by thy sages taught
raised from the quarries where their sires have wrought
AABB
be like the granite of thy rock ribbed land
as slow to rear , as obdurate to stand
and as the ice that leaves thy crystal mine
chills the fierce alcohol in the creole 's wine
AABB
the silent room , the heavy creeping shade
the dead that travel fast , the opening door
the murdered brother rising through the floor
the ghost 's white fingers on thy shoulders laid
ABBA
and then the lonely duel in the glade
the broken swords , the stifled scream , the gore
thy grand revengeful eyes when all is o'er
these things are well enough ,    but thou wert made
ABBA
for more august creation ! frenzied lear
should at thy bidding wander on the heath
with the shrill fool to mock him , romeo
for thee should lure his love , and desperate fear
ABBA
false hope prolongs my ever certain grief
traitor to me , and faithful to my love
a thousand times it promised me relief
yet never any true effect i prove
ABAB
thus often , as i chase my hope from me
straightway she hastes her unto delia 's eyes
fed with some pleasing look , there shall she be
and so sent back . and thus my fortune lies
ABAB
o gracious mother , whose benignant breast
wakes us to life , and lulls us all to rest
how thy sweet features , kind to every clime
mock with their smile the wrinkled front of time
AABB
we stain thy flowers ,— they blossom o'er the dead
we rend thy bosom , and it gives us bread
o'er the red field that trampling strife has torn
waves the green plumage of thy tasselled corn
AABB
our maddening conflicts sear thy fairest plain
still thy soft answer is the growing grain
yet , o our mother , while uncounted charms
steal round our hearts in thine embracing arms
AABB
and there she would have lain for evermore
a marble image on the shadowy shore
in outward seeming , but within oppressed
with torments , knowing neither hope nor rest
AABB
but as she lay the phoenix flew along
going to egypt , and knew all her wrong
and pitied her , beholding her sweet face
and flew to love and told him of her case
AABB
and love , in guerdon of the tale he told
changed all the feathers of his neck to gold
and he flew on to egypt glad at heart
but love himself gat swiftly for his part
AABB
from all the mischiefs that i mention here
preserve us , heaven , in this approaching year
from civil wars and those uncivil things
that hate the race of all our queens and kings
AABB
from those who for self ends would all betray
from saints that curse and flatter when they pray
from those that hold it merit to rebel
in treason , murthers , and in theft excel
AABB
from those new teachers have destroy 'd the old
and those that turn the gospel into gold
from a high court , and that rebellious crew
that did their hands in royal blood imbrue
AABB
gold , and fair marbles , and again more gold
and space of halls afloat that glance and gleam
like the green heights of sunset heaven , or seem
the golden steeps of sunrise red and cold
ABBA
on deserts where dark exile keeps the fold
fast of the flocks of torment , where no beam
falls of kind light or comfort save in dream
these we far off behold not , who behold
ABBA
the cordage woven of curses , and the decks
with mortal hate and mortal peril paven
from stem to stern the lines of doom engraven
that mark for sure inevitable wrecks
ABBA
then blue smoke haze of the cooking rose
and tent peg answered to hammer nose
and the picketed ponies , shag and wild
strained at their ropes as the feed was piled
AABB
and the bubbling camels beside the load
sprawled for a furlong adown the road
and the persian pussy cats , brought for sale
spat at the dogs from the camel bale
AABB
and the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food
and the camp fires twinkled by fort jumrood
and there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk
a savour of camels and carpets and musk
AABB
whilst by thy eyes pursued , my poor heart flew
into the sacred refuge of thy breast
thy rigour in that sanctuary slew
that which thy succ'ring mercy should have blest
ABAB
no privilege of faith could it protect
faith being with blood and five years witness signed
wherein no show gave cause of least suspect
for well thou saw'st my love and how i pined
ABAB
yet no mild comfort would thy brow reveal
no lightning looks which falling hopes erect
what boots to laws of succour to appeal
ladies and tyrants never laws respect
ABAB
yet take the colder copy from my hand
not for its own but for the master 's sake
take it , as thou , returning home , wilt take
from that divinest soft italian land
ABBA
fixed shadows of the beautiful and grand
in sunless pictures that the sun doth make
reflections that may pleasant memories wake
of all that raffael touched , or angelo planned
ABBA
as these may keep what memory else might lose
so may this photograph of verse impart
an image , though without the native hues
of calderon 's fire , and yet with calderon 's art
ABAB
the star of my mishap imposed this pain
to spend the april of my years in grief
finding my fortune ever in the wane
with still fresh cares , supplied with no relief
ABAB
yet thee i blame not , though for thee ‘ tis done
but these weak wings presuming to aspire
which now are melted by thine eyes ’ bright sun
that makes me fall from off my high desire
ABAB
and in my fall i cry for help with speed
no pitying eye looks back upon my fears
no succour find i now when most i need
my heats must drown in th'ocean of my tears
ABAB
thus near the gates conferring as they drew
argus , the dog , his ancient master knew
he , not unconscious of the voice and tread
lifts to the sound his ear , and rears his head
AABB
bred by ulysses , nourished at his board
but , ah ! not fated long to please his lord
to him , his swiftness and his strength were vain
the voice of glory called him o'er the main
AABB
till then , in every sylvan chase renowned
with argus , argus , rung the woods around
with him the youth pursued the goat or fawn
or traced the mazy leveret o'er the lawn
AABB
night is the true democracy . when day
like some great monarch with his train has passed
in regal pomp and splendor to the last
the stars troop forth along the milky way
ABBA
a jostling crowd , in radiant disarray
on heaven 's broad boulevard in pageants vast
and things of earth , the hunted and outcast
come from their haunts and hiding places ; yea
ABBA
even from the nooks and crannies of the mind
visions uncouth and vagrant fancies start
and specters of dead joy , that shun the light
and impotent regrets and terrors blind
ABBA
thine eyes i love , and they as pitying me
knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
have put on black , and loving mourners be
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
ABAB
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
and suit thy pity like in every part
ABAB
yet are mine eyes so filled with the store
of that faire sight , that nothing else they brooke
but lothe the things which they did like before
and can no more endure on them to looke
ABAB
rise then , my son , first partner of my fame
with early toils to build thy sacred name
in high behest , for his own legate known
proclaim the bounties of our sire the sun
AABB
tell how his fruits beneath our culture rise
his stars , how glorious , gem our cloudless skies
and how to us his hand hath kindly given
his peaceful laws , the purest grace of heaven
AABB
with power to widen his terrestrial sway
and give our blessings where he gives the day
yet , should the stubborn nations still prepare
the shaft of slaughter for the barbarous war
AABB
unhappy wit , like most mistaken things
atones not for that envy which it brings
in youth alone its empty praise we boast
but soon the short liv 'd vanity is lost
AABB
like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies
that gaily blooms , but ev'n in blooming dies
what is this wit , which must our cares employ
the owner 's wife , that other men enjoy
AABB
then most our trouble still when most admir 'd
and still the more we give , the more requir 'd
whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease
sure some to vex , but never all to please
AABB
but o thou cruel stepmother and hard
to thy poor fenceless , naked child , the bard
a thing unteachable in worldly skill
and half an idiot too , more helpless still
AABB
no heels to bear him from the op'ning dun
no claws to dig , his hated sight to shun
no horns , but those by luckless hymen worn
and those , alas ! not amalthea 's horn
AABB
no nerves olfact'ry , true to mammon 's foot
or grunting , grub sagacious , evil 's root
the silly sheep that wanders wild astray
is not more friendless , is not more a prey
AABB
since fate relentless stopp 'd their heavenly voice
no more the forests ring , or groves rejoice
who now shall charm the shades , where cowley strung
his living harp , and lofty denham sung
AABB
but hark ! the groves rejoice , the forest rings
are these revived ? or is it granville sings
‘ tis yours , my lord , to bless our soft retreats
and call the muses to their ancient seats
AABB
to paint anew the flowery sylvan scenes
to crown the forest with immortal greens
make windsor hills in lofty numbers rise
and lift her turrets nearer to the skies
AABB
they that have power to hurt , and will do none
that do not do the thing , they most do show
who moving others , are themselves as stone
unmoved , cold , and to temptation slow
ABAB
the summer 's flower is to the summer sweet
though to it self , it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
ABAB
those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty , and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
ABAB
gentle thou art , and therefore to be won
beauteous thou art , therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos , what woman 's son
will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
ABAB
ay me , but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
and chide thy beauty , and thy straying youth
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
ABAB
i wish i could remember that first day
first hour , first moment of your meeting me
if bright or dim the season , it might be
summer or winter for aught i can say
ABBA
so unrecorded did it slip away
so blind was i to see and to foresee
so dull to mark the budding of my tree
that would not blossom yet for many a may
ABBA
if only i could recollect it , such
a day of days ! i let it come and go
as traceless as a thaw of bygone snow
it seemed to mean so little , meant so much
ABBA
thou drowsy god , whose blurred eyes , half awink
muse on me —, drifting out upon thy dreams
i lave my soul as in enchanted streams
where revelling satyrs pipe along the brink
ABBA
and tipsy with the melody they drink
uplift their dangling hooves , and down the beams
of sunshine dance like motes . thy languor seems
an ocean depth of love wherein i sink
ABBA
like some fond argonaut , right willingly
because of wooing eyes upturned to mine
and siren arms that coil their sorcery
about my neck , with kisses so divine
ABAB
o lords our gods , the times are evil : you
redeem the time , because of evil days
while abject souls in servitude of praise
bow down to heads untitled , and the crew
ABBA
whose honour dwells but in the deeds they do
from loftier hearts your nobler servants raise
more manful salutation : yours are bays
that not the dawn 's plebeian pearls bedew
ABBA
yours , laurels plucked not of such hands as wove
old age its chaplet in colonos ’ grove
our time , with heaven and with itself at odds
makes all lands else as seas that seethe and boil
AABB
xii . and by such living witness didst thou preach
not with blind hands of groping forward thrust
into the darkness , gathering only dust
but by this real sign — that thou didst reach
ABBA
in natural order , rising each from each
thy own ideals of the true and just
and that as thou didst live , even so he must
who would aspire his fellow men to teach
ABBA
looking perpetual from new heights of thought
on his old self . of art no scorner thou
instead of leafy chaplet , on thy brow
wearing the light of manhood , thou hast brought
ABBA
within a thick and spreading hawthorn bush
that overhung a molehill large and round
i heard from morn to morn a merry thrush
sing hymns to sunrise , and i drank the sound
ABAB
with joy ; and , often an intruding guest
i watched her secret toils from day to day
how true she warped the moss , to form a nest
and modelled it within with wood and clay
ABAB
and by and by , like heath bells gilt with dew
there lay her shining eggs , as bright as flowers
ink spotted over shells of greeny blue
and there i witnessed in the sunny hours
ABAB
autumn comes laden with her ripened load
of fruitage and so scatters them abroad
that each fern smothered heath and mole hill waste
are black with bramble berries — where in haste
AABB
yet will the leaves soon patter on the ground
and death 's deaf voice awake at every sound
one drops — then others — and the last that fell
rings for those left behind their passing bell
AABB
throughout the country nothing now was heard
save talk of civil war ; yet undeterred
was he , by what was going on around
from his employment ; and kept gaining ground
AABB
the village of brave soldier 's was quite full
and they , alone , made business far from dull
when he at first commended , he made a rule
for which some folks then deemed him quite a fool
AABB
what seekest thou , far in the unknown land
in hope i follow joy gone on before
in hope and fear persistent more and more
as the dry desert lengthens out its sand
ABBA
whilst day and night i carry in my hand
the golden key to ope the golden door
of golden home ; yet mine eye weepeth sore
for long the journey is that makes no stand
ABBA
and who is this that veiled doth walk with thee
lo , this is love that walketh at my right
one exile holds us both , and we are bound
to selfsame home joys in the land of light
ABAB
the hostess whispered him she thought her spouse
again , my dear , such sparks let 's never house
pray do n't you hear how they together chat
just then the husband raised himself and sat
AABB
is this your plan ? said he with mighty rage
was it for this you would my house engage
you understand me , but i 'll seek redress
think you so very cheap to have success
AABB
what , would you ruin families at will
and with our daughters take at ease your fill
away , i say ! my house this moment quit
and as for you , abominable chit
AABB
then while eurynome the mandate bears
from heaven minerva shoots with guardian cares
o'er all her senses , as the couch she press 'd
she pours , a pleasing , deep and death like rest
AABB
with every beauty every feature arms
bids her cheeks glow , and lights up all her charms
in her love darting eyes awakes the fires
( immortal gifts ! to kindle soft desires
AABB
from limb to limb an air majestic sheds
and the pure ivory o'er her bosom spreads
such venus shines , when with a measured bound
she smoothly gliding swims the harmonious round
AABB
soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish
short is the glory of the blushing rose
the hue which thou so carefully dost nourish
yet which at length thou must be forced to lose
ABAB
when thou , surcharged with burden of thy years
shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth
and that in beauty 's lease expired appears
the date of age , the kalends of our death
ABAB
behold him trav'lling o'er th ’ extensive space
between the realms of darkness and our race
to pass it , scarcely he a moment took
on florence instantly he cast a look
AABB
delighted with the beauty of the spot
he there resolved to fix his earthly lot
regarding it as proper for his wiles
a city famed for wanton freaks and guiles
AABB
belphegor soon a noble mansion hired
and furnished it with ev'ry thing desired
as signor roderick he designed to pass
his equipage was large of ev'ry class
AABB
on many a saddened hearth the evening fire
burns paler as the children 's hour draws near
that joyous hour his song made doubly dear
and tender memories touch the faltering choir
ABBA
he sings no more on earth ; our vain desire
aches for the voice we loved so long to hear
in dorian flute notes breathing soft and clear
the sweet contralto that could never tire
ABBA
deafened with listening to a harsher strain
the maenad 's scream , the stark barbarian 's cry
still for those soothing , loving tones we sigh
oh , for our vanished orpheus once again
ABBA
mine eyes are filled today with old amaze
at mountains , and at meadows deftly strewn
with bits of the gay jewelry of june
and of her splendid vesture ; and , agaze
ABBA
i stand where spring her bright brocade of days
embroidered o'er , and listen to the flow
of sudden runlets — the faint blasts they blow
low , on their stony bugles , in still ways
ABBA
for wonders are at one , confederate yet
yea , where the wearied year came to a close
an odor reminiscent of the rose
and everywhere her seal has summer set
ABBA
this life is full of numbness and of balk
of haltingness and baffled short coming
of promise unfulfilled , of everything
that is puffed vanity and empty talk
ABBA
its very bud hangs cankered on the stalk
its very song bird trails a broken wing
its very spring is not indeed like spring
but sighs like autumn round an aimless walk
ABBA
call for clear water , wash thine hands , be clean
cry , what is truth ? o pilate ; thou shalt know
haply too soon , and gnash thy teeth for woe
ere the outer darkness take thee round unseen
ABBA
that hides the red ghosts of thy race obscene
bound nine times round with hell 's most dolorous flow
and in its pools thy crownless head lie low
by his of spain who dared an english queen
ABBA
with half a world to hearten him for fight
till the wind gave his warriors and their might
to shipwreck and the corpse encumbered sea
but thou , take heed , ere yet thy lips wax white
AABB
outbound , your bark awaits you . were i one
whose prayer availeth much , my wish should be
your favoring trade wind and consenting sea
by sail or steed was never love outrun
ABBA
and , here or there , love follows her in whom
all graces and sweet charities unite
the old greek beauty set in holier light
and her for whom new england 's byways bloom
ABBA
who walks among us welcome as the spring
calling up blossoms where her light feet stray
god keep you both , make beautiful your way
comfort , console , and bless ; and safely bring
ABBA
i purposed once to take my pen and write
not songs , like some , tormented and awry
with passion , but a cunning harmony
of words and music caught from glen and height
ABBA
and lucid colours born of woodland light
and shining places where the sea streams lie
but this was when the heat of youth glowed white
and since i 've put the faded purpose by
ABAB
i have no faultless fruits to offer you
who read this book ; but certain syllables
herein are borrowed from unfooted dells
and secret hollows dear to noontide dew
ABBA
from yonder realms of empyrean day
bursts on my ear the indignant lay
there sit the sainted sage , the bard divine
the few whom genius gave to shine
AABB
to bless the place where on their opening soul
first the genuine ardour stole
‘ twas milton struck the deep toned shell
and , as the choral warblings round him swell
AABB
dorset , the grace of courts , the muses ’ pride
patron of arts , and judge of nature , died
the scourge of pride , though sanctified or great
of fops in learning , and of knaves in state
AABB
yet soft his nature , though severe his lay
his anger moral , and his wisdom gay
bless 'd satirist ! who touch 'd the mean so true
as show 'd vice had his hate and pity too
AABB
blest courtier ! who could king and country please
yet sacred keep his friendships , and his ease
blest peer ! his great forefathers ’ every grace
reflecting , and reflected in his race
AABB
despairless ! hopeless ! quietly i wait
on these unpeopled tracks the happy close
of day , whose advent rang with noise elate
whose later stage was quick with mirthful shows
ABAB
and clasping loves , with hate and hearty blows
and dreams of coming gifts withheld by fate
from morrow unto morrow , till her great
dread eyes ‘ gan tell of other gifts than those
ABBA
and her advancing wings gloomed like a pall
her speech foretelling joy became a dirge
as piteous as pitiless ; and all
my company had passed beyond the verge
ABAB
then thus the son : “ from alybas i came
my palace there ; eperitus my name
not vulgar born : from aphidas , the king
of polyphemon 's royal line , i spring
AABB
some adverse demon from sicania bore
our wandering course , and drove us on your shore
far from the town , an unfrequented bay
relieved our wearied vessel from the sea
AABB
rome , athens , memphis , tyre ! had you butknown
this glorious triad , now familiar grown
the press , the magnet faithful to its pole
and earth 's own movement round her steadfast goal
AABB
ne'er had your science , from that splendid height
sunk in her strength , nor seen succeeding night
her own utility had forced her sway
all nations caught the fast extending ray
AABB
where , then , thou bold instinct , shal i begin
my endlesse taske ? to thanke her were a sin
great as not speake , and not to speake , a blame
beyond what 's worst , such as doth want a name
AABB
though god is sovereign , we free agents are
accountable to him for all we do
feel , think , or say ; and at the last great day
a most exact account must render too
ABAB
` suffiseth this , my fulle freend pandare
that i have seyd , for now wostow my wo
and for the love of god , my colde care
so hyd it wel , i telle it never to mo
ABAB
stern be the pilot in the dreadful hour
when a great nation , like a ship at sea
with the wroth breakers whitening at her lee
feels her last shudder if her helmsman cower
ABBA
from our hot records then thy name shall stand
on time 's calm ledger out of passionate days
with the pure debt of gratitude begun
and only paid in never ending praise
ABAB
o great and wise , clear souled and high of heart
one the last flower of catholic love , that grows
amid bare thorns their only thornless rose
from the fierce juggling of the priests ’ loud mart
ABBA
yet alien , yet unspotted and apart
from the blind hard foul rout whose shameless shows
mock the sweet heaven whose secret no man knows
with prayers and curses and the soothsayer 's art
ABBA
one like a storm god of the northern foam
strong , wrought of rock that breasts and breaks the sea
and thunders back its thunder , rhyme for rhyme
answering , as though to outroar the tides of time
AABB
avenge , o lord , thy slaughtered saints , whose bones
lie scattered on the alpine mountains cold
even them who kept thy truth so pure of old
when all our fathers worshipped stocks and stones
ABBA
forget not : in thy book record their groans
who were thy sheep , and in their ancient fold
slain by the bloody piedmontese that rolled
mother with infant down the rocks . their moans
ABBA
the vales redoubled to the hills , and they
to heaven . their martyred blood and ashes sow
o'er all the italian fields , where still doth sway
the triple tyrant ; that from these may grow
ABAB
vast hollow voids , beyond the utmost reach
of suns , their legions withering at his nod
died into day hearing the voice of god
and seas new made , immense and furious , each
ABBA
for to create is still god 's prime delight
the large moon , all alone , sailed her dark lake
and the first tides were moving to her might
then darkness trembled , and began to quake
ABAB
say over again , and yet once over again
that thou dost love me . though the word repeated
should seem a “ cuckoo song , ” as thou dost treat it
remember , never to the hill or plain
ABBA
valley and wood , without her cuckoo strain
comes the fresh spring in all her green completed
beloved , i , amid the darkness greeted
by a doubtful spirit voice , in that doubt 's pain
ABBA
cry , “ speak once more — thou lovest ! ” who can fear
too many stars , though each in heaven shall roll
too many flowers , though each shall crown the year
say thou dost love me , love me , love me — toll
ABAB
there 's not a nook within this solemn pass
but were an apt confessional for one
taught by his summer spent , his autumn gone
that life is but a tale of morning grass
ABBA
untouched , unbreathed upon . thrice happy quest
if from a golden perch of aspen spray
( october 's workmanship to rival may
the pensive warbler of the ruddy breast
ABBA
happy is england ! i could be content
to see no other verdure than its own
to feel no other breezes than are blown
through its tall woods with high romances blent
ABBA
yet do i sometimes feel a languishment
for skies italian , and an inward groan
to sit upon an alp as on a throne
and half forget what world or worldling meant
ABBA
happy is england , sweet her artless daughters
enough their simple loveliness for me
enough their whitest arms in silence clinging
yet do i often warmly burn to see
ABAB
the irresponsive silence of the land
the irresponsive sounding of the sea
speak both one message of one sense to me
aloof , aloof , we stand aloof , so stand
ABBA
thou too aloof bound with the flawless band
of inner solitude ; we bind not thee
but who from thy self chain shall set thee free
what heart shall touch thy heart ? what hand thy hand
ABBA
and i am sometimes proud and sometimes meek
and sometimes i remember days of old
when fellowship seemed not so far to seek
and all the world and i seemed much less cold
ABAB
no other choice belphegor now had got
than — try himself the hymeneal knot
in florence he beheld a certain fair
with charming face and smart engaging air
AABB
of noble birth , but puffed with empty pride
some marks of virtue , though not much beside
for roderick was asked this lofty dame
the father said honesta * ( such her name
AABB
had many eligible offers found
but , ‘ mong the num'rous band that hovered round
perhaps his daughter , rod'rick ' s suit might take
though he should wish for time the choice to make
AABB
‘ twas the night after christmas , and all through the house
not a creature was stirring — excepting a mouse
the stockings were flung in haste over the chair
for hopes of st. nicholas were no longer there
AABB
the children were restlessly tossing in bed
for the pie and the candy were heavy as lead
while mamma in her kerchief , and i in my gown
had just made up our minds that we would not lie down
AABB
when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter
i sprang from my chair to see what was the matter
away to the window i went with a dash
flung open the shutter , and threw up the sash
AABB
care charmer sleep , son of the sable night
brother to death , in silent darkness born
relieve my anguish , and restore the light
with dark forgetting of my care , return
ABAB
and let the day be time enough to mourn
the shipwreck of my ill advised youth
let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn
without the torments of the night 's untruth
ABAB
cease , dreams , the images of day desires
to model forth the passions of to morrow
never let the rising sun prove you liars
to add more grief , to aggravate my sorrow
ABAB
the winds have talked with him confidingly
the trees have whispered to him ; and the night
hath held him gently as a mother might
and taught him all sad tones of melody
ABBA
his verse blooms like a flower , night and day
bees cluster round his rhymes ; and twitterings
of lark and swallow , in an endless may
are mingling with the tender songs he sings
ABAB
if thou hadst been a painter , what fresh looks
what outbursts of pent glories , what new grace
had shone upon us from the great world 's face
how had we read , as in eternal books
ABBA
the love of god in loneliest shiest nooks
a lily , in merest lines thy hand did trace
had plainly been god 's child of lower race
and oh how strong the hills , songful the brooks
ABBA
to thee all nature 's meanings lie light bare
because thy heart is nature 's inner side
clear as , to us , earth on the dawn 's gold tide
her notion vast up in thy soul did rise
ABBA
sweet soul , which , in the april of thy years
for to enrich the heaven mad'st poor this round
and now , with flaming rays of glory crown 'd
most blest abides above the sphere of spheres
ABBA
if heavenly laws , alas ! have not thee bound
from looking to this globe that all upbears
if ruth and pity there above be found
oh , deign to lend a look unto these tears
ABAB
do not disdain , dear ghost , this sacrifice
and though i raise not pillars to thy praise
my offerings take , let this for me suffice
my heart a living pyramid i raise
ABAB
surely thou seest , o spirit of light and fire
surely thou canst not choose , o soul , but see
the days whose dayspring was beheld of thee
ere eyes less pure might have their hope 's desire
ABBA
beholding life in heaven again respire
where men saw nought that was or was to be
save only death imperial . thou and he
who has the heart of all men 's hearts for lyre
ABBA
ye twain , being great of spirit as time is great
and sure of sight as truth 's own heavenward eye
beheld the forms of forces passing by
and certitude of equal balanced fate
ABBA
lo , the poor indian ! whose untutored mind
sees god in clouds , or hears him in the wind
his soul , proud science never taught to stray
far as the solar walk , or milky way
AABB
yet simple nature to his hope has given
behind the cloud topped hill , an humbler heaven
some safer world in depths of woods embraced
some happier island in the watery waste
AABB
where slaves once more their native land behold
no fiends torment , no christians thirst for gold
to be , contents his natural desire
he asks no angel 's wing , no seraph 's fire
AABB
these wonders strange be sees , and many more
whose head is pregnant with poetic lore
should he upon an evening ramble fare
with forehead to the soothing breezes bare
AABB
would he naught see but the dark , silent blue
with all its diamonds trembling through and through
or the coy moon , when in the waviness
of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress
AABB
and staidly paces higher up , and higher
like a sweet nun in holy day attire
ah , yes ! much more would start into his sight
the revelries , and mysteries of night
AABB
then welcome be it , if indeed it be
the irrepressible conflict ! let it come
there will be mitigation of the doom
if , battling to the last , our sires shall see
ABBA
their sons contending for the homes made free
in ancient conflict with the foreign foe
if those who call us brethren strike the blow
no common conflict shall the invader know
AABB
war to the knife , and to the last , until
the sacred land we keep shall overflow
with blood as sacred — valley , wave , and hill
or the last enemy finds his bloody grave
ABAB
that thou hast her it is not all my grief
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly
ABAB
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
thou dost love her , because thou know'st i love her
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her
ABAB
if i lose thee , my loss is my love 's gain
and losing her , my friend hath found that loss
both find each other , and i lose both twain
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
ABAB
brown hills long parched , long lifting to the blue
of summer 's brilliant sky but russet hue
of sere grass shivering in the trade wind 's sweep
soon , with light footfalls , from their tranced sleep
AABB
the first rains bid the poppies rise anew
and trills the lark exultant summons , too
how swift at fancy 's beck those gay crowds leap
to glowing life ! the eager green leaves creep
AABB
for welcome first ; then hooded buds , pale gold
each tender shower and sun kiss help unfold
till smiling hosts crowd all the fields , and still
a yellow sea of poppies breasts each hill
AABB
“ such be the plea , and by the plea deceive
for jove infatuates all , and all believe
yet leave for each of us a sword to wield
a pointed javelin , and a fenceful shield
AABB
but by my blood that in thy bosom glows
by that regard a son his father owes
the secret , that thy father lives , retain
lock 'd in thy bosom from the household train
AABB
hide it from all ; e'en from eumaeus hide
from my dear father , and my dearer bride
one care remains , to note the loyal few
whose faith yet lasts among the menial crew
AABB
king solomon , before his palace gate
at evening , on the pavement tessellate
was walking with a stranger from the east
arrayed in rich attire as for a feast
AABB
the mighty runjeet sing , a learned man
and rajah of the realms of hindostan
and as they walked the guest became aware
of a white figure in the twilight air
AABB
gazing intent , as one who with surprise
his form and features seemed to recognize
and in a whisper to the king he said
“ what is yon shape , that , pallid as the dead
AABB
there you are waiting , little friendly house
those are your chimney stacks with you between
surrounded by old trees and strolling cows
staring through all your windows at the green
ABAB
your homely floor is creaking for our tread
the smiling tea pot with contented spout
thinks of the boiling water , and the bread
longs for the butter . all their hands are out
ABAB
aisles and abysses ; leagues no man explores
of rock that labyrinths and night that drips
where everlasting silence broods , with lips
of adamant , o'er earthquakehyppphenbuilded floors
ABBA
where forms , such as the demon world adores
laborious water carves ; whence echo ships
wild tongued o'er pools where petrifaction strips
her breasts of crystal from which crystal pours
ABBA
here where primordial fear , the gorgon , sits
staring all life to stone in ghastly mirth
i seem to tread , with awe no tongue can tell
beneath vast domes , by torrent tortured pits
ABBA
he spoke abrupt across my dream : “ dear garden
a stranger to your magic peace , i stand
beyond your walls , lost in a fevered land
of stones and fire . would that the gods would harden
ABBA
my soul against its torment , or would blind
those yearning glimpses of a life at rest
in perfect beauty — glimpses at the best
through unpassed bars . and here , without , the wind
ABBA
of scattering passion blows : and women pass
glitter eyed down putrid alleys where the glass
of some grimed window suddenly parades
ah , sickening heart beat of desire !— the grace
AABB
for mercy though still cries my moan clad muse
and every paper that she sends to beauty
in tract of sable tears brings woeful news
of my true heart kind thoughts , and loyal duty
ABAB
but ah the strings of her hard heart are strained
beyond the harmony of my desires
and though the happy heavens themselves have pained
to tame her heart whose will so far aspires
ABAB
come with fresh airs breathing the faint perfume
of deep walled gardens , groves of whispering pine
scatter soft dews , waft pure sea scent of brine
in sweet repose man 's pain , man 's love resume
ABBA
deep bosomed night ! not here where down the marge
marble with palaces those lamps of earth
tremble on trembling blackness ; nay , far hence
there on the lake where space is lone and large
ABBA
this said , within her anxious mind she weighs
the means of cutting short her odious days
then to sichaeus ’ nurse she briefly said
( for , when she left her country , hers was dead
AABB
“ go , barce , call my sister . let her care
the solemn rites of sacrifice prepare
the sheep , and all th ’ atoning off'rings bring
sprinkling her body from the crystal spring
AABB
with living drops ; then let her come , and thou
with sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow
thus will i pay my vows to stygian jove
and end the cares of my disastrous love
AABB
rude is the tent this architect invents
rural the place , with cart ruts by dyke side
dead grass , horse hair , and downy headed bents
tied to dead thistles — she doth well provide
ABAB
close to a hill of ants where cowslips bloom
and shed oer meadows far their sweet perfume
in early spring , when winds blow chilly cold
the yellowhammer , trailing grass , will come
AABB
no sooner youth throws off his infant plays
the harmless pastime of his happier days
but past a child , is still in judgement so
and studies first what he is not to know
AABB
pleasure and sence his easie soul entice
spurr 'd forward by his native love to vice
a mistress now his fancy entertains
and youthful vigour boils within his brains
AABB
the poor lost maid he do 's with oaths intice
and loads his soul with twenty thousand lyes
promises marriage , love , a hundred things
till both himself and her , he to destruction brings
AABB
i ioy to see how , in your drawen work
your selfe unto the bee ye doe compare
and me unto the spyder , that doth lurke
in close awayt , to catch her unaware
ABAB
ah whither , poor forsaken , wilt thou go
to go from sorrow and thine own distress
when every place presents like face of woe
and no remove can make thy sorrows less
ABAB
yet go , forsaken ! leave these woods , these plains
leave her and all , and all for her that leaves
thee and thy love forlorn , and both disdains
and of both wrongful deems and ill conceives
ABAB
seek out some place , and see if any place
can give the least release unto thy grief
convey thee from the thought of thy disgrace
steal from thyself and be thy cares ’ own thief
ABAB
for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
who for thy self art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt , thou art beloved of many
but that thou none lov'st is most evident
ABAB
for thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate
that ‘ gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
ABAB
o change thy thought , that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
or to thy self at least kind hearted prove
ABAB
how do i keep thee ? let me count the ways
i bar up every breadth and depth and height
my hands can reach , while feeling out of sight
for bolts that stick and hasps that will not raise
ABBA
i keep thee from the public 's idle gaze
i keep thee in , by sun or candle light
i keep thee , rude , as women strive for right
i keep thee boldly , as they seek for praise
ABBA
i keep thee with more effort than i 'd use
to keep a dry goods shop or big hotel
i keep thee with a power i seemed to lose
with that last cook . i 'll keep thee down the well
ABAB
he moves conspicuous , vigilant , severe
with his light cavalry hand and seat and look
a living type of order , in whose sphere
is room for neither hooligan nor hook
ABAB
for in his shadow , wheresoe'er he ride
paces , all eye and hardihood and grip
the dreaded crusher , might in his every stride
and right materialized girt at his hip
ABAB
yes , pile the marble o'er him ! it is well
that ye who mocked him in his long stern strife
and planted in the pathway of his life
the ploughshares of your hatred hot from hell
ABBA
who clamored down the bold reformer when
he pleaded for his captive fellow men
who spurned him in the market place , and sought
within thy walls , st. tammany , to bind
AABB
in party chains the free and honest thought
the angel utterance of an upright mind
well is it now that o'er his grave ye raise
the stony tribute of your tardy praise
AABB
this bronze doth keep the very form and mold
of our great martyr 's face . yes , this is he
that brow all wisdom , all benignity
that human , humorous mouth ; those cheeks that hold
ABBA
like some harsh landscape all the summer 's gold
that spirit fit for sorrow , as the sea
for storms to beat on ; the lone agony
those silent , patient lips too well foretold
ABBA
yes , this is he who ruled a world of men
as might some prophet of the elder day
brooding above the tempest and the fray
with deep eyed thought and more than mortal ken
ABBA
k áú s , the king , now joins the mournful chief
and tries to soothe his deep and settled grief
for soon or late we yield our vital breath
and all our worldly troubles end in death
AABB
“ when first i saw him , graceful in his might
he looked far other than a tartar knight
wondering i gazed — now destiny has thrown
him on thy sword — he fought , and he is gone
AABB
and should even heaven against the earth be hurled
or fire inwrap in crackling flames the world
that which is past — we never can restore
his soul has travelled to some happier shore
AABB
at last , so faire a ladie did i spie
that thinking yet on her i burne and quake
on hearbs and flowres she walked pensively
milde , but yet love she proudly did forsake
ABAB
white seem 'd her robes , yet woven so they were
as snow and golde together had been wrought
above the wast a darke clowde shrouded her
a stinging serpent by the heele her caught
ABAB
woe to the sceptic in these party days
who wafts to neither shrine his puffs of praise
for him no pension pours its annual fruits
no fertile sinecure spontaneous shoots
AABB
not his the meed that crowned don hookham 's rhyme
nor sees he e'er in dreams of future time
those shadowy forms of sleek reversions rise
so dear to scotchmen 's second sighted eyes
AABB
yet who that looks to history 's damning leaf
where whig and tory , thief opposed to thief
on either side in lofty shame are seen
while freedom 's form lies crucified between
AABB
he should have followed who goes forth before us
last born of us in life , in death first born
the last to lift up eyes against the morn
the first to see the sunset . life , that bore us
ABBA
silent . but if , beyond all change or time
a law more just , more equal , more sublime
than sways the surge of life 's loud sterile sea
sways that still world whose peace environs him
AABB
when he the subtle venom had subdued
he took her hand , and having fondly sued
said he , your pardon lady now i ask
be not displeased when i remove the mask
AABB
your rage restrain ; a trick on you 's been played
calimachus am i ; be not dismayed
approve my sacrifice ; the secret 's known
your rigour would be useless now if shown
AABB
should i be doomed howe'er to breathe my last
i die content , rememb'ring what has passed
you have the means my life at will to take
more havock with me soft delight could make
AABB
sweet be the bands the which true love doth tye
without constraynt or dread of any ill
the gentle birde feeles no captivity
within her cage , but sings , and feeds her fill
ABAB
there pride dare not approch , nor discord spill
the league twixt them that loyal love hath bound
but simple truth and mutual good will
seeks with sweet peace to salve each others wound
ABAB
ah ! once again the long left wires among
truants the muse to weave her requiem song
with sterner lore now busied , erst the lay
cheer 'd my dark morn of manhood , wont to stray
AABB
o'er fancy 's fields in quest of musky flower
to me nor fragrant less , though barr 'd from view
and courtship of the world : hail 'd was the hour
that gave me , dripping fresh with nature 's dew
ABAB
poor henry 's budding beauties — to a clime
hapless transplanted , whose exotic ray
forced their young vigour into transient day
and drain 'd the stalk that rear 'd them ! and shall time
ABBA
apollo bows , and from mount ida ’ s height
swift to the field precipitates his flight
thence from the war the breathless hero bore
veil ’ d in a cloud , to silver simois ’ shore
AABB
there bathed his honourable wounds , and dress ’ d
his manly members in the immortal vest
and with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews
restores his freshness , and his form renews
AABB
then sleep and death , two twins of winged race
of matchless swiftness , but of silent pace
received sarpedon , at the god ’ s command
and in a moment reach ’ d the lycian land
AABB
then mua leads him through the glorious land
of matchless splendor , on the border grand
of those wide happy fields that spread afar
o'er beaming hills and vales , where ambient air
AABB
‘ neath trees of luring fruits she leads the way
through paths of flowers where night hath fled away
a wilderness of varied crystal flowers
where fragrance rests o'er clustering , shining bowers
AABB
chaotic crags are huddled east and west
dark , heavy crags , against a straitened sea
that cometh , like a troubled soul in quest
of voiceless rest where never dwelleth rest
AABB
with noise “ like thunder everlasting
but here , behold a silent space of sand
oh , pilgrim , halt !— it even seems to be
asleep in other years . how still ! how grand
ABAB
how awful in its wild solemnity
this is the spot on which the chief did land
and there , perchance , he stood what time a band
of yelling strangers scoured the savage lea
ABBA
mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye , my heart thy picture 's sight would bar
my heart , mine eye the freedom of that right
ABAB
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
( a closet never pierced with crystal eyes
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
ABAB
to side this title is impanelled
a quest of thoughts , all tenants to the heart
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eye 's moiety , and the dear heart 's part
ABAB
when comes the lighted day for men to read
life 's meaning , with the work before their hands
till this good gift of breath from debt is freed
earth will not hear her children 's wailful bands
ABAB
deplore the chieftain fall'n in sob and dirge
nor they look where is darkness , but on high
the sun that dropped down our horizon 's verge
illumes his labours through the travelled sky
ABAB
now seen in sum , most glorious ; and ‘ tis known
by what our warrior wrought we hold him fast
a splendid image built of man has flown
his deeds inspired of god outstep a past
ABAB
“ my mistress ’ worth gave wings unto my muse
and my muse wings did give unto her name
so , like twin birds , my muse bred with her fame
together now do learn their wings to use
ABBA
and in this book , which here you may peruse
abroad they fly , resolved to try the same
adventure in their flight ; and thee , sweet dame
both she and i for our protection choose
ABBA
i by my vow , and she by farther right
under your phoenix ( wing ) presume to fly
that from all carrion beaks in safety might
by one same wing be shrouded , she and i
ABAB
hear what the desolate rizpah said
as on gibeah 's rocks she watched the dead
the sons of michal before her lay
and her own fair children , dearer than they
AABB
by a death of shame they all had died
and were stretched on the bare rock , side by side
and rizpah , once the loveliest of all
that bloomed and smiled in the court of saul
AABB
all wasted with watching and famine now
and scorched by the sun her haggard brow
sat mournfully guarding their corpses there
and murmured a strange and solemn air
AABB
so tired am i , so weary of to day
so unrefreshed from foregone weariness
so overburdened by foreseen distress
so lagging and so stumbling on my way
ABBA
i scarce can rouse myself to watch or pray
to hope , or aim , or toil for more or less
ah , always less and less , even while i press
forward and toil and aim as best i may
ABBA
half starved of soul and heartsick utterly
yet lift i up my heart and soul and eyes
( which fail in looking upward ) toward the prize
me , lord , thou seest though i see not thee
ABBA
home from her convent to the palace came
the lovely princess emma , whose sweet name
whispered by seneschal or sung by bard
had often touched the soul of eginhard
AABB
he saw her from his window , as in state
she came , by knights attended through the gate
he saw her at the banquet of that day
fresh as the morn , and beautiful as may
AABB
he saw her in the garden , as she strayed
among the flowers of summer with her maid
and said to him , “ o eginhard , disclose
the meaning and the mystery of the rose
AABB
to day , all day , i rode upon the down
with hounds and horsemen , a brave company
on this side in its glory lay the sea
on that the sussex weald , a sea of brown
ABBA
the wind was light , and brightly the sun shone
and still we galloped on from gorse to gorse
and once , when checked , a thrush sang , and my horse
pricked his quick ears as to a sound unknown
ABBA
i knew the spring was come . i knew it even
better than all by this , that through my chase
in bush and stone and hill and sea and heaven
i seemed to see and follow still your face
ABAB
i wrote in mirrha 's bark , and as i wrote
poor mirrha wept because i wrote forsaken
‘ twas of thy pride i sung in weeping note
when as her leaves great moan for pity maken
ABAB
the rising pines wherein i had engraved
thy memory consulting with the wind
are trucemen to thy heart and thoughts depraved
and say , thy kind should not be so unkind
ABAB
how blest is he who knows no meaner strife
than art 's long battle with the foes of life
no doubt assails him , doing still his best
and trusting kindly nature for the rest
AABB
no mocking conscience tears the thin disguise
that wraps his breast , and tells him that he lies
he comes : the languid sufferer lifts his head
and smiles a welcome from his weary bed
AABB
he speaks : what music like the tones that tell
“ past is the hour of danger ,— all is well
how can he feel the petty stings of grief
whose cheering presence always brings relief
AABB
where fair ææ ia smiles across the sea
to olive crowned italia , th ’ enchantress dwells
a woman set about with dreams and spells
weird incantations , charms and mystery
ABBA
most strangely pale and strangely fair is she
yet deadlier than the hemlock draught her smile
darker than stygian glooms her subtle guile
drawn by her deep eyes ’ spell , across the sea
ABBA
passing i saw her as she stood beside
a lonely stream between two barren wolds
her loose vest hung in rudely gathered folds
on her swart bosom , which in maiden pride
ABBA
pillowed a string of pearls ; among her hair
twined the light bluebell and the stone crop gay
and not far thence the small encampment lay
curling its wreathed smoke into the air
ABBA
you 're no adulterer :— nor a thief am i
when i see plate and wisely pass it by
but take away the danger , in a trice
nature unbridled plunges into vice
AABB
what ? you to be my master , who obey
more persons , nay , more things than words can say
whom not the praetor 's wand , though four times waved
could make less tyrant ridden , less enslaved
AABB
press home the matter further : how d'ye call
the thrall who 's servant to another thrall
an understrapper , say ; the name will do
or fellow servant : such am i to you
AABB
that time was come , or seem 'd as it was come
when death no longer makes the grave his home
when waking spirits leave their earthly rest
to mix for ever with the damn 'd or blest
AABB
when years , in drowsy thousands counted by
are hung on minutes with their destiny
when time in terror drops his draining glass
and all things mortal , like to shadows , pass
AABB
as ‘ neath approaching tempests sinks the sun
when time shall leave eternity begun
life swoon 'd in terror at that hour 's dread birth
as in an ague , shook the fearful earth
AABB
there 's not a budding boy , or girl , this day
but is got up , and gone to bring in may
a deal of youth , ere this , is come
back , and with white thorn laden home
AABB
some have dispatch 'd their cakes and cream
before that we have left to dream
and some have wept , and woo 'd , and plighted troth
and chose their priest , ere we can cast off sloth
AABB
in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes
for they in thee a thousand errors note
but ‘ tis my heart that loves what they despise
who in despite of view is pleased to dote
ABAB
nor are mine cars with thy tongue 's tune delighted
nor tender feeling to base touches prone
nor taste , nor smell , desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone
ABAB
but my five wits , nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man
thy proud heart 's slave and vassal wretch to be
ABAB
hesper again his heavenly power display 'd
and shook the yielding canopy of shade
sudden the stars their trembling fires withdrew
returning splendors burst upon the view
AABB
floods of unfolding light the skies adorn
and more than midday glories grace the morn
so shone the earth , as if the sideral train
broad as full suns , had sail 'd the ethereal plain
AABB
when no distinguisht orb could strike the sight
but one clear blaze of all surrounding light
o'erflow ' d the vault of heaven . for now in view
remoter climes and future ages drew
AABB
why thus unjustly , say , my cruel fate
dost thou adjudge my luckless eyes and heart
the one to live exiled from that sweet smart
where th ’ other pines , imprisoned without date
ABBA
my luckless eyes must never more debate
of those bright beams that eased my love apart
and yet my heart , bound to them with love 's dart
must there dwell ever to bemoan my state
ABBA
o had mine eyes been suffered there to rest
often they had my heart 's unquiet eased
or had my heart with banishment been blest
mine eye with beauty never had been pleased
ABAB
when thou shalt be disposed to set me light
and place my merit in the eye of scorn
upon thy side , against my self i 'll fight
and prove thee virtuous , though thou art forsworn
ABAB
with mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults concealed , wherein i am attainted
that thou in losing me , shalt win much glory
ABAB
and i by this will be a gainer too
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
the injuries that to my self i do
doing thee vantage , double vantage me
ABAB
with wonder priam view ’ d the godlike man
extoll ’ d the happy prince , and thus began
“ o bless ’ d atrides ! born to prosperous fate
successful monarch of a mighty state
AABB
how vast thy empire ! of your matchless train
what numbers lost , what numbers yet remain
in phrygia once were gallant armies known
in ancient time , when otreus fill ’ d the throne
AABB
when godlike mygdon led their troops of horse
and i , to join them , raised the trojan force
against the manlike amazons we stood
and sangar ’ s stream ran purple with their blood
AABB
devoid of reason , thrall to foolish ire
i walk and chase a savage fairy still
now near the flood , straight on the mounting hill
now midst the woods of youth , and vain desire
ABBA
for leash i bear a cord of careful grief
for brach i lead an over forward mind
my hounds are thoughts , and rage despairing blind
pain , cruelty , and care without relief
ABBA
but they perceiving that my swift pursuit
my flying fairy cannot overtake
with open mouths their prey on me do make
like hungry hounds that lately lost their suit
ABBA
the raging monarch shook his azure head
and thus in secret to his soul he said
“ heavens ! how uncertain are the powers on high
is then reversed the sentence of the sky
AABB
in one man 's favour ; while a distant guest
i shared secure the aethiopian feast
behold how near phoenecia 's land he draws
the land affix 'd by fate 's eternal laws
AABB
who 'll , know it ? richard earnestly replied
in jack 's concealment we may both confide
excuse the trick i 've played and ne'er repine
address , force , treachery , in love combine
AABB
all are permitted when intrigue ‘ s the word
to hold the contrary were quite absurd
till stratagem was used i naught could gain
but looks and darts from eyes , for all my pain
AABB
i 've paid myself ;— would you have done it ?— no
‘ tis all as might be wished ;— come , smiles bestow
i 'm satisfied , the fault was not with you
in this , to make you wretched , naught i view
AABB
“ for lo ! i haste to those remote abodes
where the great parents , ( sacred source of gods
ocean and tethys their old empire keep
on the last limits of the land and deep
AABB
in their kind arms my tender years were past
what time old saturn , from olympus cast
of upper heaven to jove resign ’ d the reign
whelm ’ d under the huge mass of earth and main
AABB
for strife , i hear , has made the union cease
which held so long that ancient pair in peace
what honour , and what love , shall i obtain
if i compose those fatal feuds again
AABB
night is the true democracy . when day
like some great monarch with his train has passed
in regal pomp and splendor to the last
the stars troop forth along the milky way
ABBA
a jostling crowd , in radiant disarray
on heaven 's broad boulevard in pageants vast
and things of earth , the hunted and outcast
come from their haunts and hiding places ; yea
ABBA
even from the nooks and crannies of the mind
visions uncouth and vagrant fancies start
and specters of dead joy , that shun the light
and impotent regrets and terrors blind
ABBA
i stood upon the stone where ela lay
the widowed founder of these ancient walls
where fancy still on meek devotion calls
marking the ivied arch , and turret gray
ABBA
for her soul 's rest — eternal rest — to pray
where visionary nuns yet seem to tread
a pale dim troop , the cloisters of the dead
though twice three hundred years have flown away
ABBA
but when , with silent step and pensive mien
in weeds , as mourning for her sisters gone
the mistress of this lone monastic scene
came ; and i heard her voice 's tender tone
ABAB
slow toiling upward from ’ the misty vale
i leave the bright enamelled zones below
no more for me their beauteous bloom shall glow
their lingering sweetness load the morning gale
ABBA
few are the slender flowerets , scentless , pale
that on their ice clad stems all trembling blow
along the margin of unmelting snow
yet with unsaddened voice thy verge i hail
ABBA
white realm of peace above the flowering line
welcome thy frozen domes , thy rocky spires
o'er thee undimmed the moon girt planets shine
on thy majestic altars fade the fires
ABAB
ah , god ! the world needs many hours to make
nor hast thou ceased the making of it yet
but wilt be working on when death hath set
a new mound in some churchyard for my sake
ABBA
on flow the centuries without a break
uprise the mountains , ages without let
the mosses suck the rock 's breast , rarely wet
years more than past , the young earth yet will take
ABBA
but in the dumbness of the rolling time
no veil of silence will encompass me
thou wilt not once forget , and let me be
i easier think that thou , as i my rhyme
ABBA
raising my hopes on hills of high desire
thinking to scale the heaven of her heart
my slender means presumed too high a part
her thunder of disdain forced me retire
ABBA
and threw me down to pain in all this fire
where lo , i languish in so heavy smart
because th'attempt was far above my art
her pride brooked not poor souls should come so nigh her
ABBA
yet , i protest , my high desiring will
was not to dispossess her of her right
her sovereignty should have remain è d still
i only sought the bliss to have her sight
ABAB
a path , old tree , goes by thee crooking on
and through this little gate that claps and bangs
against thy rifted trunk , what steps hath gone
though but a lonely way , yet mystery hangs
ABAB
oer crowds of pastoral scenes recordless here
the boy might climb the nest in thy young boughs
that 's slept half an eternity ; in fear
the herdsman may have left his startled cows
ABAB
for shelter when heaven 's thunder voice was near
here too the woodman on his wallet laid
for pillow may have slept an hour away
and poet pastoral , lover of the shade
ABAB
what better tale could any lover tell
when age or death his reckoning shall write
than thus , ‘ love taught me only to rebel
against these things ,— the thieving of delight
ABAB
without return ; the gospellers of fear
who , loving , yet deny the truth they bear
sad suited lusts with lecherous hands to smear
the cloth of gold they would but dare not wear
ABAB
and love gave me great knowledge of the trees
and singing birds , and earth with all her flowers
wisdom i knew and righteousness in these
i lived in their atonement all my hours
ABAB
to him the chief : “ what then remains to do
the event of things the gods alone can view
charged by achilles ’ great command i fly
and bear with haste the pylian king ’ s reply
AABB
but thy distress this instant claims relief
he said , and in his arms upheld the chief
the slaves their master ’ s slow approach survey ’ d
and hides of oxen on the floor display ’ d
AABB
there stretch ’ d at length the wounded hero lay
patroclus cut the forky steel away
then in his hands a bitter root he bruised
the wound he wash ’ d , the styptic juice infused
AABB
insect or blossom ? fragile , fairy thing
poised upon slender tip , and quivering
to flight ! a flower of the fields of air
a jeweled moth ; a butterfly , with rare
AABB
and tender tints upon his downy wings
a moment resting in our happy sight
a flower held captive by a thread so slight
its petal wings of broidered gossamer
ABBA
a giant sentinel , alone it stands
on rocky headland where the breakers roar
parted from piny woods and pebbled shore
holding out branches as imploring hands
ABBA
poor lonely tree , where never bird doth make
its nest , or sing at morn and eve to thee
nor in whose shadow wild rose calleth bee
to come on gauzy wing for love 's sweet sake
ABBA
nature cares for thee , gives thee sunshine gold
handfuls of pearls cast from the crested waves
for thee pink throated shells soft murmurs hold
and seaweed vested chorists chant in caves
ABAB
‘ twas but a moment , for that respect
which clothes all courage their voices checked
and something the wildest could understand
spake in the old man 's strong right hand
AABB
and his corded throat , and the lurking frown
of his eyebrows under his old bell crown
until , as they gazed , there crept an awe
through the ranks in whispers , and some men saw
AABB
in the antique vestments and long white hair
the past of the nation in battle there
and some of the soldiers since declare
that the gleam of his old white hat afar
AABB
i christened you in happier days , before
these gray forebodings on my brow were seen
you are still lovely in your new leaved green
the brimming river soothes his grassy shore
ABBA
the bridge is there ; the rock with lichens hoar
and the same shadows on the water lean
outlasting us . how many graves between
that day and this ! how many shadows more
ABBA
darken my heart , their substance from these eyes
hidden forever ! so our world is made
of life and death commingled ; and the sighs
outweigh the smiles , in equal balance laid
ABAB
maiden , when such a soul as thine is born
the morning stars their ancient music make
and , joyful , once again their song awake
long silent now with melancholy scorn
ABBA
and thou , not mindless of so blest a morn
by no least deed its harmony shalt break
but shalt to that high chime thy footsteps take
through life 's most darksome passes unforlorn
ABBA
therefore from thy pure faith thou shalt not fall
therefore shalt thou be ever fair and free
and in thine every motion musical
as summer air , majestic as the sea
ABAB
projectiles , music , and the sculptor 's art
his chestnut whistle and his shingle dart
his elder pop gun with its hickory rod
its sharp explosion and rebounding wad
AABB
his corn stalk fiddle , and the deeper tone
that murmurs from his pumpkin stalk trombone
conspire to teach the boy . to these succeed
his bow , his arrow of a feathered reed
AABB
his windmill , raised the passing breeze to win
his water wheel , that turns upon a pin
or , if his father lives upon the shore
you 'll see his ship , “ beam ends upon the floor
AABB
six thousand years of commune , god with man
two thousand years of ohrist ; yet from such roots
immortal , earth reaps only bitterest fruits
the fiends rage now as when they first began
ABBA
hate , lust , greed , vanity , triumphant still
yell , shout , exult , and lord o'er human will
the sun moves back ! the fond convictions felt
that , in the progress of the race , we stood
AABB
two thousand years of height above the flood
before the day 's experience sink and melt
as frost beneath the fire ! and what remains
of all our grand ideals and great gains
AABB
she entered as the holy monk desired
and they together to his cell retired
the friar on the bed this maiden threw
a kiss would take :— she from him rather drew
AABB
and said .— to give one wit is this the way
yes , answered he , and round her ‘ gan to play
upon her bosom then he put his hand
what now , said she , am i to understand
AABB
is this the way ?— said he , ‘ tis so decreed
then patiently she let the monk proceed
who followed up , from point to point , his aim
and wit , by easy steps , advancing came
AABB
immortal eloquence of mystic art
how strangely o'er oblivion and gray time
that hand doth speak , as in the painter 's prime
it uttered thus his own and mary 's heart
ABBA
at sight of it , what rich conjectures start
adown the years , what wistful aves chime
that wake the soul to rapture how sublime
wherewith we , too , must bear in him our part
ABBA
for unto each to bring redemption 's share
whereby adown the ages christ is borne
there comes the angel of the lilied rod
and though our souls with anguish sore are torn
ABAB
love , knowing that dear image to be his
woke up within the sick heart sorrow bowed
unto the sighs which are its weary load
saying , “ go forth . ” and they went forth , i wis
ABBA
in florence once there dwelled a gentle youth
who loved a certain beauteous belle with truth
o'er all his actions she had full controul
to please he would have sold his very soul
AABB
if she amusements wished , he 'd lavish gold
convinced in love or war you should be bold
the cash ne'er spare :— invincible its pow'rs
o'erturning walls or doors where'er it show'rs
AABB
the precious ore can every thing o'ercome
‘ twill silence barking curs : make servants dumb
and these can render eloquent at will
excel e'en tully in persuasive skill
AABB
they dub thee idler , smiling sneeringly
and why ? because , forsooth , so many moons
here dwelling voiceless by the voiceful sea
thou hast not set thy thoughts to paltry tunes
ABAB
in song or sonnet . them these golden noons
oppress not with their beauty ; they could prate
even while a prophet read the solemn runes
on which is hanging some imperial fate
ABAB
how know they , these good gossips , what to thee
the ocean and its wanderers may have brought
how know they , in their busy vacancy
with what far aim thy spirit may be fraught
ABAB
long as her ship , tost with so manie freakes
had all the world in armes against her bent
was never seene that anie fortunes wreakes
could breake her course begun with brave intent
ABAB
but , when the obiect of her vertue failed
her power it selfe against it selfe did arme
as he that having long in tempest sailed
faine would arive , but cannot for the storme
ABAB
fain had they also entered that great horse
but all the host withheld them , bidding stay
with them a shipboard , ordering their array
for men far better work the works of war
ABBA
of the clenched eyes , and the soul 's vast distress
has she forgotten thus the old caress
that made our breath a quickened atmosphere
that failed nigh unto swooning with the sheer
AABB
delight ? mine arms clutch now this earthen heap
sodden with tears that flow on ceaselessly
as autumn rains the long , long , long nights weep
in memory of days that used to be
ABAB
brother !— our eldest , first born from the dead
of all the glorified the living head
yet condescending to the youngest child
with tenderest looks and accents sweet and mild
AABB
who feels a wrong done to the feeblest one
keenly , as though unto himself ‘ twere done
who , sees no kindness to the humblest shown
but ‘ lisas though ‘ twere to himself alone
AABB
and who will judge the wrong , the kindness bless
with all a brother 's truth and tenderness
nay , more : an earthly brother faints and dies
or faithless oft , forgets affections ties
AABB
god give us men ; a time like this demands
strong minds , great hearts , true faith and ready hands
men whom the lust of office cannot kill
men whom the spoils of office cannot buy
AABB
tall men , sun crowned , who live above the fog
in public duty and in private thinking
for while the rabble , with its thumb worn creeds
its large professions , and its little deeds
AABB
no otherwise than raynie cloud , first fed
with earthly vapours gathered in the ayre
eftsoones in compas arch't , to steepe his hed
doth plonge himselfe in tethys bosome faire
ABAB
and , mounting up againe from whence he came
with his great bellie spreds the dimmed world
till at the last , dissolving his moist frame
in raine , or snowe , or haile , he forth is horld
ABAB
this citie , which was first but shepheards shade
uprising by degrees , grewe to such height
that queene of land and sea her selfe she made
at last , not able to beare so great weight
ABAB
why , thou being changeless , changeful did i write
trusting thy truth , yet doubting thy defect
now all triumphant , now confounded quite
sad suited all , or proud in purple deck 'd
ABAB
did i not write of thy rare constancy
wherein was none like thee , thou like to none
swear that thy heart within my heart did lie
past all removal till the world were done
ABAB
e'en so ; but though , when clouds the region hold
masking with envious murk the sun 's bright face
our o'ergloom ' d spirits shudder ‘ neath the cold
he merits not the blame of that disgrace
ABAB
oft and in vain my rebel thoughts have ventured
to stop the passage of my vanquished heart
and shut those ways my friendly foe first entered
hoping thereby to free my better part
ABAB
and whilst i guard the windows of this fort
where my heart 's thief to vex me made her choice
and thither all my forces do transport
another passage opens at her voice
ABAB
her voice betrays me to her hand and eye
my freedom 's tyrant , conquering all by art
but ah ! what glory can she get thereby
with three such powers to plague one silly heart
ABAB
the other two , slight air , and purging fire
are both with thee , wherever i abide
the first my thought , the other my desire
these present absent with swift motion slide
ABAB
until life 's composition be recured
by those swift messengers returned from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health , recounting it to me
ABAB
it one day happened , that this forward spark
the girl we speak of , met within the park
and to a summer house the fav'rite drew
the course they took the princess chanced to view
AABB
as wand'ring near ; but neither swain nor fair
suspicion had , that any one was there
and this gallant most confidently thought
the girl by force , might to his terms be brought
AABB
his wretched temper , obstacle to love
and ev'ry bliss bestowed by heav'n above
had oft his hopes of favours lately marred
and fear , with those designs , had also jarred
AABB
man was not made for forms , but forms for man
and there are times when law itself must bend
to that clear spirit always in the van
outspeeding human justice . in the end
ABAB
potentates , not humanity , must fall
water will find its level , fire will burn
the winds must blow around the earthly ball
the earthly ball by day and night must turn
ABAB
freedom is typed in every element
man must be free , if not through law , why then
above the law , until its force be spent
and justice brings a better . but , o , when
ABAB
since dark december shrouds the transient day
and stormy winds are howling in their ire
why com'st not thou , who always can'st inspire
the soul of cheerfulness , and best array
ABBA
a sullen hour in smiles ?— o haste to pay
the cordial visit sullen hours require
around the circling walls a glowing fire
shines ;— but it vainly shines in this delay
ABBA
to blend thy spirit 's warm promethean light
come then , at science ’ , and at friendship 's call
their vow 'd disciple ;— come , for they invite
the social powers without thee languish all
ABAB
thou radiant coachman , running endless course
fountain of heat , of light the lively source
life of the world , lamp of this universe
heaven 's richest gem : oh , teach me where my verse
AABB
may but begin thy praise : alas ! i fare
much like to one that in the clouds doth stare
to count the quails , that with their shadow cover
the italian sea , when soaring hither over
AABB
fain of a milder and more fruitful clime
they come with us to pass the summer time
no sooner he begins one shoal to sum
but , more and more , still greater shoals do come
AABB
yet , after peace has turned the clean white page
there shall be sorrow on the earth for years
abysmal grief , that has no eyes for tears
and youth that hobbles through the earth like age
ABBA
but better to play this part upon life 's stage
than to aid structures that a tyrant rears
to live a stalwart hireling torn with fears
and shamed by feeding on a conqueror s wage
ABBA
death , yea , a thousand deaths , were sweet in truth
rather than such ignoble life . god gave
being , and breath , and high resolve to youth
that it might be wrong 's master , not its slave
ABAB
has she forgotten ? on this very may
we were to meet here , with the birds and bees
as on that sabbath , underneath the trees
we strayed among the tombs , and stripped away
ABBA
the vines from these old granites , cold and gray
and yet indeed not grim enough were they
to stay our kisses , smiles and ecstasies
or closer voice lost vows and rhapsodies
AABB
has she forgotten — that the may has won
its promise ?— that the bird songs from the tree
are sprayed above the grasses as the sun
might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly
ABAB
the world has no such flower in any land
and no such pearl in any gulf the sea
as any babe on any mother 's knee
but all things blessed of men by saints are banned
ABBA
god gives them grace to read and understand
the palimpsest of evil , writ where we
poor fools and lovers but of love , can see
nought save a blessing signed by love 's own hand
ABBA
the smile that opens heaven on us for them
hath sin 's transmitted birthmark hid therein
the kiss it craves calls down from heaven a rod
if innocence be sin that gods condemn
ABBA
slowly the hour hand of the clock moves round
so slowly that no human eye hath power
to see it move ! slowly in shine or shower
the painted ship above it , homeward bound
ABBA
sails , but seems motionless , as if aground
yet both arrive at last ; and in his tower
the slumberous watchman wakes and strikes the hour
a mellow , measured , melancholy sound
ABBA
midnight ! the outpost of advancing day
the frontier town and citadel of night
the watershed of time , from which the streams
of yesterday and to morrow take their way
ABBA
there 's nothing i know of to make you spend
a day of your life at cragwell end
it 's a village quiet and grey and old
a little village tucked into a fold
AABB
( a sort of valley , not over wide
of the hills that flank it on either side
there 's a large grey church with a square stone tower
and a clock to mark you the passing hour
AABB
in a chime that shivers the village calm
with a few odd bits of the 100th psalm
a red brick vicarage stands thereby
breathing comfort and lapped in ease
AABB
‘ oft , when the world imagine women stray
the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way
through all the giddy circle they pursue
and old impertinence expel by new
AABB
what tender maid but must a victim fall
to one man 's treat , but for another 's ball
when florio speaks , what virgin could withstand
if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand
AABB
with varying vanities , from every part
they shift the moving toyshop of their heart
where wigs with wigs , with sword knots sword knots strive
beaux banish beaux , and coaches coaches drive
AABB
the nodding oxeye bends before the wind
the woodbine quakes lest boys their flowers should find
and prickly dogrose spite of its array
ca n't dare the blossom seeking hand away
AABB
while thistles wear their heavy knobs of bloom
proud as a warhorse wears its haughty plume
and by the roadside danger 's self defy
on commons where pined sheep and oxen lie
AABB
in ruddy pomp and ever thronging mood
it stands and spreads like danger in a wood
and in the village street where meanest weeds
ca n't stand untouched to fill their husks with seeds
AABB
guarded within the old red wall 's embrace
marshalled like soldiers in gay company
the tulips stand arrayed . here infantry
wheels out into the sunlight . what bold grace
ABBA
sets off their tunics , white with crimson lace
here are platoons of gold frocked cavalry
with scarlet sabres tossing in the eye
of purple batteries , every gun in place
ABBA
forward they come , with flaunting colours spread
with torches burning , stepping out in time
to some quick , unheard march . our ears are dead
we cannot catch the tune . in pantomime
ABAB
his friends , for sure they well that title claim
first thought the licence of his tongue to blame
but , when they mark 'd how deeply he was mov 'd
they sooth 'd and cherish 'd rather than reprov 'd
AABB
each day , as mute he sat in desperate grief
they spoke kind words of comfort and relief
each day , howe'er they sought , howe'er they sued
scarce might they win his lips to taste of food
AABB
‘ come , welcome death ! ’ forever was his cry
‘ lo , here a wretch who wishes but to die
so still he wail 'd , till woe such mastery wan
they trembled for his nobler powers of man
AABB
iii . heav'n from all creatures hides the book of fate
all but the page prescrib 'd , their present state
from brutes what men , from men what spirits know
or who could suffer being here below
AABB
the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day
had he thy reason , would he skip and play
pleas 'd to the last , he crops the flow'ry food
and licks the hand just rais 'd to shed his blood
AABB
oh blindness to the future ! kindly giv'n
that each may fill the circle mark 'd by heav'n
who sees with equal eye , as god of all
a hero perish , or a sparrow fall
AABB
then let good nature every charm exert
and while it mends it , win th ’ unfolding heart
let moral mirth a face of triumph wear
yet smile unconscious of th ’ extorted tear
AABB
see with what grace instructive satire flows
politely keen , in olio 's numbered prose
that great example should our zeal excite
and censors learn from addison to write
AABB
so , in our age , too prone to sport with pain
might soft humanity resume her reign
pride without rancour feel th ’ objected fault
and folly blush , as willing to be taught
AABB
here is the place where loveliness keeps house
between the river and the wooded hills
within a valley where the springtime spills
her firstling wind flowers under blossoming boughs
ABBA
where summer sits braiding her warm , white brows
with bramble roses ; and where autumn fills
her lap with asters ; and old winter frills
with crimson haw and hip his snowy blouse
ABBA
a gentle shepherd , born in arcady
that well could tune his pipe , and deftly play
the nymphs asleep with rural minstrelsy
methought i saw , upon a summer 's day
ABAB
but with the god he long time had not been
ere he the shepherd and himself forgot
and most ingrateful , ever stepp 'd between
pan and all good befell the poor man 's lot
ABAB
ye patriot crowds , who burn for england 's fame
ye nymphs , whose bosoms beat at milton 's name
whose generous zeal , unbought by flattering rhymes
shames the mean pensions of augustan times
AABB
immortal patrons of succeeding days
attend this prelude of perpetual praise
let wit , condemn 'd the feeble war to wage
with close malevolence , or public rage
AABB
let study , worn with virtue 's fruitless lore
behold this theatre , and grieve no more
this night , distinguish 'd by your smiles , shall tell
that never briton can in vain excel
AABB
grant , fairest kind , a kiss unto thy friend
a blush replied , and yet a kiss i had
it is not heaven that can such nectar send
whereat my senses all amazed were glad
ABAB
this done , she fled as one that was affrayed
and i desired to kiss by kissing more
my love she frowned , and i my kissing stayed
yet wished to kiss her as i did before
ABAB
then as the vine the propping elm doth clasp
loath to depart till both together die
so fold me , sweet , until my latest gasp
that in thy arms to death i kissed may lie
ABAB
immense , august , like some titanic bloom
the mighty choir unfolds its lithic core
petalled with panes of azure , gules and or
splendidly lambent in the gothic gloom
ABBA
and stamened with keen flamelets that illume
the pale high altar . on the prayer worn floor
by worshippers innumerous thronged of yore
a few brown crones , familiars of the tomb
ABBA
the stranded driftwood of faith 's ebbing sea
for these alone the finials fret the skies
the topmost bosses shake their blossoms free
while from the triple portals , with grave eyes
ABAB
like a beautiful face looking ever at me
a pure bright moon cometh over the sea
and i stand on the crags , and hear the falls
go tumbling down , through the black river walls
AABB
and the heart of the gorge is rent with the cry
of the pent up winds in their agony
you are far from me , dear , where i watch and wait
like a weary bird for a long lost mate
AABB
and my life is as dull as the sluggish stream
feeling its way through a world of dream
for here is a waste of darkness and fear
and i call and i call , but no one will hear
AABB
o my heart 's heart , and you who are to me
more than myself myself , god be with you
keep you in strong obedience leal and true
to him whose noble service setteth free
ABBA
give you all good we see or can foresee
make your joys many and your sorrows few
bless you in what you bear and what you do
yea , perfect you as he would have you be
ABBA
so much for you ; but what for me , dear friend
to love you without stint and all i can
to day , to morrow , world without an end
to love you much and yet to love you more
ABAB
and now a shadow and a terror fell
on the great house , as if a passing bell
tolled from the tower , and filled each spacious room
with secret awe , and preternatural gloom
AABB
the petted boy grew ill , and day by day
pined with mysterious malady away
the mother 's heart would not be comforted
her darling seemed to her already dead
AABB
and often , sitting by the sufferer 's side
“ what can i do to comfort thee ? ” she cried
at first the silent lips made no reply
but , moved at length by her importunate cry
AABB
at after diner daun iohn sobrely
this chapman took a part , and prively
he seyde him thus , ‘ cosyn , it standeth so
that wel i see to brugges wol ye go
AABB
bitwix us two nedeth no strange fare
fare wel , cosyn ; god shilde yow fro care
if any thing ther be by day or night
if it lye in my power and my might
AABB
since i left you , mine eye is in my mind
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function , and is partly blind
seems seeing , but effectually is out
ABAB
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird , of flower , or shape which it doth latch
of his quick objects hath the mind no part
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
ABAB
for if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight
the most sweet favour or deformed'st creature
the mountain , or the sea , the day , or night
the crow , or dove , it shapes them to your feature
ABAB
in florence once there dwelled a gentle youth
who loved a certain beauteous belle with truth
o'er all his actions she had full controul
to please he would have sold his very soul
AABB
if she amusements wished , he 'd lavish gold
convinced in love or war you should be bold
the cash ne'er spare :— invincible its pow'rs
o'erturning walls or doors where'er it show'rs
AABB
the precious ore can every thing o'ercome
‘ twill silence barking curs : make servants dumb
and these can render eloquent at will
excel e'en tully in persuasive skill
AABB
‘ twas in a land unkempt of life 's red dawn
where in his sanded cave he dwelt alone
sleeping by day , or sometimes worked upon
his flint head arrows and his knives of stone
ABAB
by night stole forth and slew the savage boar
so that he loomed a hunter of loud fame
and many a skin of wolf and wild cat wore
and counted many a flint head to his name
ABAB
wherefore he walked the envy of the band
hated and feared , but matchless in his skill
till lo ! one night deep in that shaggy land
he tracked a yearling bear and made his kill
ABAB
i saw a wolfe under a rockie cave
noursing two whelpes ; i saw her litle ones
in wanton dalliance the teate to crave
while she her neck wreath 'd from them for the nones
ABAB
thou who hast made for such sure purposes
the mightiest and the meanest thing that is
planned out the lives of insects of the air
with fine precision and consummate care
AABB
thou who hast taught the bee the secret power
of carrying on love 's laws ‘ twixt flower and flower
why didst thou shape this mortal frame of mine
if heavenly joys alone were thy design
AABB
wherefore the wonder of my woman 's breast
by lips of lover and of babe unpressed
if spirit children only shall reply
unto my ever urgent mother cry
AABB
i wandered through scoglietto 's far retreat
the oranges on each o'erhanging spray
burned as bright lamps of gold to shame the day
some startled bird with fluttering wings and fleet
ABBA
made snow of all the blossoms ; at my feet
like silver moons the pale narcissi lay
and the curved waves that streaked the great green bay
laughed i ’ the sun , and life seemed very sweet
ABBA
outside the young boy priest passed singing clear
‘ jesus the son of mary has been slain
o come and fill his sepulchre with flowers
ah , god ! ah , god ! those dear hellenic hours
AABB
the crystal stream wherein my love did swim
melted in tears as partners of my woe
her shine was such as did the fountain dim
the pearl like fountain whiter than the snow
ABAB
then like perfume , resolv è d with a heat
the fountain smoked , as if it thought to burn
a wonder strange to see the cold so great
and yet the fountain into smoke to turn
ABAB
i searched the cause , and found it to be this
she touched the water , and it burned with love
now by her means it purchased hath that bliss
which all diseases quickly can remove
ABAB
by the fond name that was his own and mine
the last upon his lips that strove with doom
he called me and i saw the light assume
a sudden glory and around him shine
ABBA
and nearer now i saw the laureled line
of the august of song before me loom
and knew the voices , erstwhile through the gloom
that whispered and forbade me to repine
ABBA
and with farewell , a shaft of splendor sank
out of the stars and faded as a flame
and down the night , on clouds of glory , came
the battle seraphs halting rank on rank
ABBA
so long your reign , said richard , o'er my mind
deny i could not , howsoe'er inclined
with mrs. simon often is your spouse
her character no doubt your spleen will rouse
AABB
i 've no design , observe to give offence
but , when i see your int'rest in suspense
i cannot silent keep ; though , were i still
a slave , devoted wholly to your will
AABB
as late i moved , i would not drop a word
mistrust of lovers may not be absurd
besides , you 'd fancy other motives led
to tell you of your husband what was said
AABB
thee had we followed through the twilight land
where thought grows form , and matter is refined
back into thought of the eternal mind
till , seeing them one , lo , in the morn we stand
ABBA
then started fresh and followed , hand in hand
with sense divinely growing , till , combined
we heard the music of the planets wind
in harmony with billows on the strand
ABBA
o silent lover of a world day worn
taking the weary light to thy dusk arms
stealing where pale forms lie , sun hurt and torn
waiting the balm of thy oblivious charms
ABAB
make me thy captive ere i guess pursuit
and cast me deep within some dreamless close
where hopes stir not , and white , wronged lips are mute
and pain 's hot wings fold down o'er hush è d woes
ABAB
love , though for this you riddle me with darts
and drag me at your chariot till i die
oh , heavy prince ! oh , panderer of hearts
yet hear me tell how in their throats they lie
ABAB
who shout you mighty : thick about my hair
day in , day out , your ominous arrows purr
who still am free , unto no querulous care
a fool , and in no temple worshiper
ABAB
i , that have bared me to your quiver 's fire
lifted my face into its puny rain
do wreathe you impotent to evoke desire
as you are powerless to elicit pain
ABAB
lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head , each under eye
doth homage to his new appearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty
ABAB
and having climbed the steep up heavenly hill
resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
ABAB
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes ( fore duteous ) now converted are
from his low tract and look another way
ABAB
six days and nights a doubtful course we steer
the next proud lamos ’ stately towers appear
and laestrygonia 's gates arise distinct in air
the shepherd , quitting here at night the plain
AABB
calls , to succeed his cares , the watchful swain
but he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear
and adds the herdsman 's to the shepherd 's care
so near the pastures , and so short the way
ABBA
great babylon her haughtie walls will praise
and sharped steeples high shot up in ayre
greece will the olde ephesian buildings blaze
and nylus nurslings their pyramidcs faire
ABAB
the same yet vaunting greece will tell the storie
of ioves great image in olympus placed
mausolus worke will be the carians glorie
and crete will boast the labyrinth , now raced
ABAB
month after month in widowhood of soul
drooping the maiden saw two summers roll
their suns away — but , ah , how cold and dim
even summer suns when not beheld with him
AABB
from time to time ill omened rumors came
like spirit tongues muttering the sick man 's name
just ere he dies :— at length those sounds of dread
fell withering on her soul , “ azim is dead
AABB
oh grief beyond all other griefs when fate
first leaves the young heart lone and desolate
in the wide world without that only tie
for which it loved to live or feared to die
AABB
another field rose high with waving grain
with bended sickles stand the reaper train
here stretched in ranks the levell ’ d swarths are found
sheaves heap ’ d on sheaves here thicken up the ground
AABB
with sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands
the gatherers follow , and collect in bands
and last the children , in whose arms are borne
( too short to gripe them ) the brown sheaves of corn
AABB
the rustic monarch of the field descries
with silent glee , the heaps around him rise
a ready banquet on the turf is laid
beneath an ample oak ’ s expanded shade
AABB
love with her hair my love by force hath tied
to serve her lips , her eyes , her voice , her hand
i smiled for joy , when i the boy espied
to lie unchained and live at her command
ABAB
she if she look , or kiss , or sing , or smile
cupid withal doth smile , doth sing , doth kiss
lips , hands , voice , eyes , all hearts that may beguile
because she scorns all hearts but only this
ABAB
venus for this in pride began to frown
that cupid , born a god , enthralled should be
she in disdain her pretty son threw down
and in his place , with love she chain è d me
ABAB
this bronze our lincoln 's noble head doth bear
behold the strength and splendor of that face
so homely beautiful , with just a trace
of humor lightening its look of care
ABBA
with bronze indeed his memory doth share
this martyr who found freedom for a race
both shall endure beyond the time and place
that knew them first , and brighter grow with wear
ABBA
yet in the darksome crypt i left so late
whose only altar is its rusted grate
sepulchral , rayless , joyless as it seems
shamed by the glare of may 's refulgent beams
AABB
while the dim seasons dragged their shrouded train
its paler splendors were not quite in vain
from these dull bars the cheerful firelight 's glow
streamed through the casement o'er the spectral snow
AABB
here , while the night wind wreaked its frantic will
on the loose ocean and the rock bound hill
rent the cracked topsail from its quivering yard
and rived the oak a thousand storms had scarred
AABB
but troy repulsed , and scatter ’ d o ’ er the plains
forced from the navy , yet the fight maintains
now every greek some hostile hero slew
but still the foremost , bold patroclus flew
AABB
as areilycus had turn ’ d him round
sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound
the brazen pointed spear , with vigour thrown
the thigh transfix ’ d , and broke the brittle bone
AABB
headlong he fell . next , thoas was thy chance
thy breast , unarm ’ d , received the spartan lance
phylides ’ dart ( as amphidus drew nigh
his blow prevented , and transpierced his thigh
AABB
fair by inheritance , whom born we see
both in the wondrous year and on the day
wherein the fairest planet beareth sway
the heavens to thee this fortune doth decree
ABBA
thou of a world of hearts in time shall be
a monarch great , and with one beauty 's ray
so many hosts of hearts thy face shall slay
as all the rest for love shall yield to thee
ABBA
but even as alexander when he knew
his father 's conquests wept , lest he should leave
no kingdom unto him for to subdue
so shall thy mother thee of praise bereave
ABAB
she gave up beauty in her tender youth
gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways
she covered up her eyes lest they should gaze
on vanity , and chose the bitter truth
ABBA
harsh towards herself , towards others full of ruth
servant of servants , little known to praise
long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days
she schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth
ABBA
that with the poor and stricken she might make
a home , until the least of all sufficed
her wants ; her own self learned she to forsake
counting all earthly gain but hurt and loss
ABAB
at length the awful revelation came
crushing at once his pride of birth and name
the hopes his yearning bosom forward cast
and the ancestral glories of the vast
AABB
all fell together , crumbling in disgrace
a turret rent from battlement to base
his daughters talking in the dead of night
in their own chamber , and without a light
AABB
listening , as he was wont , he overheard
and learned the dreadful secret , word by word
and hurrying from his castle , with a cry
he raised his hands to the unpitying sky
AABB
as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put beside his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strength 's abundance weakens his own heart
ABAB
so i for fear of trust , forget to say
the perfect ceremony of love 's rite
and in mine own love 's strength seem to decay
o'ercharged with burthen of mine own love 's might
ABAB
o let my looks be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love , and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more expressed
ABAB
many the wonders i this day have seen
the sun , when first he kist away the tears
that fill 'd the eyes of morn ;— the laurel 'd peers
who from the feathery gold of evening lean
ABBA
e'en now , dear george , while this for you i write
cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping
so scantly , that it seems her bridal night
and she her half discover 'd revels keeping
ABAB
how well this man unfolded to our view
the world 's beliefs of death and heaven and hell
this man whose own convictions none could tell
nor if his maze of reason had a clew
ABBA
dogmas he wrote for daily bread , but knew
the fair philosophies of doubt so well
that while we listened to his words there fell
some that were strangely comforting , though true
ABBA
marking how wise we grew upon his doubt
we said : “ if so , by groping in the night
he can proclaim some certain paths of trust
how great our profit if he saw about
ABBA
having this day my horse , my hand , my lance
guided so well , that i obtain 'd the prize
both by the judgment of the english eyes
and of some sent from that sweet enemy france
ABBA
horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance
townfolks my strength ; a daintier judge applies
his praise to sleight which from good use doth rise
some lucky wits impute it but to chance
ABBA
others , because of both sides i do take
my blood from them who did excel in this
think nature me a man of arms did make
how far they shot awry ! the true cause is
ABAB
the wide , bright temple of the world i found
and entered from the dizzy infinite
that i might kneel and worship thee in it
leaving the singing stars their ceaseless round
ABBA
of silver music sound on orbed sound
for measured spaces where the shrines are lit
and men with wisdom or with little wit
implore the gods that mercy may abound
ABBA
ah , aphrodite , was it not from thee
my summons came across the endless spaces
mother of love , turn not thy face from me
now that i seek for thee in human faces
ABAB
not for less love , all glorious france , to thee
“ sweet enemy ” called in days long since at end
now found and hailed of england sweeter friend
bright sister of our freedom now , being free
ABBA
not for less love or faith in friendship we
whose love burnt ever toward thee reprehend
the vile vain greed whose pursy dreams portend
between our shores suppression of the sea
ABBA
not by dull toil of blind mechanic art
shall these be linked for no man 's force to part
nor length of years and changes to divide
but union only of trust and loving heart
AABB
“ such are the men who , with instinctive dread
whenever freedom lifts her drooping head
make prophet tripods of their office stools
and scare the nurseries and the village schools
AABB
with dire presage of ruin grim and great
a broken union and a foundered state
such are the patriots , self bound to the stake
of office , martyrs for their country 's sake
AABB
who fill themselves the hungry jaws of fate
and by their loss of manhood save the state
in the wide gulf themselves like cortius throw
and test the virtues of cohesive dough
AABB
she blessed them , and with voices lifted up
in loud lament the dregs of sorrow 's cup
they drained together . orpah , weeping , turned
and slowly went , but ruth with eyes that yearned
AABB
down the strait vistas where a city street
fades in pale dust and vaporous distances
stained with far fumes the light grows less and less
and the sky reddens round the day 's retreat
ABBA
now out of orient chambers , cool and sweet
like nature 's pure lustration , dusk comes down
now the lamps brighten and the quickening town
rings with the trample of returning feet
ABBA
and pleasure , risen from her own warm mould
sunk all the drowsy and unloved daylight
in layers of odorous softness , paphian girls
cover with gauze , with satin , and with pearls
AABB
of all the kings that ever here did reign
edward named fourth as first in praise i name
not for his fair outside , nor well lined brain
although less gifts imp feathers oft on fame
ABAB
nor that he could , young wise , wise valiant , frame
his sire 's revenge , join 'd with a kingdom 's gain
and , gain 'd by mars , could yet mad mars so tame
that balance weigh 'd what sword did late obtain
ABAB
take down thy stars , o god ! we look not up
in vain thou hangest there thy changeless sign
we lift our eyes to power 's glowing cup
nor care if blood make strong that wizard wine
ABAB
what though the soul be from the body shrunk
and we array the temple , but no god
what though , the cup of golden greed once drunk
our dust be laid in a dishonoured sod
ABAB
the tablet of my heavy fortunes here
upon thine altar , paphian power , i place
the grievous shipwreck of my travels dear
in bulg è d bark , all perished in disgrace
ABAB
that traitor love was pilot to my woe
my sails were hope , spread with my sighs of grief
the twin lights which my hapless course did show
hard by th'inconstant sands of false relief
ABAB
were two bright stars which led my view apart
a siren 's voice allured me come so near
to perish on the marble of her heart
a danger which my soul did never fear
ABAB
six thousand veterans practis 'd in war 's game
tried men , at killicranky were array 'd
against an equal host that wore the plaid
shepherds and herdsmen .— like a whirlwind came
ABBA
the highlanders , the slaughter spread like flame
and garry thundering down his mountain road
was stopp 'd , and could not breathe beneath the load
of the dead bodies . ‘ twas a day of shame
ABBA
for them whom precept and the pedantry
of cold mechanic battle do enslave
oh ! for a single hour of that dundee
who on that day the word of onset gave
ABAB
she starts , with eyes upturn 'd and fleeting breath
in their raised axes views her instant death
spreads her white hands to heaven in frantic prayer
then runs to grasp their knees , and crouches there
AABB
her hair , half lost along the shrubs she past
rolls in loose tangles round her lovely waist
her kerchief torn betrays the globes of snow
that heave responsive to her weight of woe
AABB
does all this eloquence suspend the knife
does no superior bribe contest her life
there does : the scalps by british gold are paid
a long hair 'd scalp adorns that heavenly head
AABB
thou in whose all no work imperfect stands
thou who dost gaze on beauty 's unveiled face
grant to thy children thy sustaining grace
when low at length have run the daylight sands
ABBA
when , though their day was set to thy commands
they bow contritely in prayer 's holy place
because through strivings beauty wards they trace
the sad misshapings of their earthly hands
ABBA
grant them at eve a soul devoutly still
grant them in dreams a vision of thy light
grant them at morn a sorrow purged away
into the peace of all absolving night
ABAB
after so long a race as i have run
through faery land , which those six books compile
give leave to rest me being half foredonne
and gather to my selfe new breath awhile
ABAB
then , as a steed refreshed after toyle
out of my prison i will break anew
and stoutly will that second work assoyle
with strong endevour and attention dew
ABAB
till then give leave to me in pleasant mew
to sport my muse , and sing my loves sweet praise
the contemplation of whose heavenly hew
my spirit to an higher pitch will rayse
ABAB
lift up thy light on us and on thine own
o soul whose spirit on earth was as a rod
to scourge off priests , a sword to pierce their god
a staff for man 's free thought to walk alone
ABBA
a lamp to lead him far from shrine and throne
on ways untrodden where his fathers trod
ere earth 's heart withered at a high priest 's nod
and all men 's mouths that made not prayer made moan
ABBA
from bonds and torments and the ravening flame
surely thy spirit of sense rose up to greet
lucretius , where such only spirits meet
and walk with him apart till shelley came
ABBA
through the sweet vales a quire of damsels sing
eternall p æ ans to their king
the stars with sparkling light stand round i see
twinkling to their shrill melodie
AABB
her and her tender darling , then i spy
i ’ th ’ mid ’ st of that blest company
with looks more fresh and sweet , then are the roses
of which her garlands shee composes
AABB
hark ! how the bitter winter breezes blow
round the sharp rocks and o'er the half lifted wave
while all the rocky woodland branches rave
shrill with the piercing cold , and every cave
AABB
and the gloom coloured clouds that stain the skies
with pictures of a warmth , and frozen glow
spread over endless fields of sheeted snow
and white untrodden mountains shining cold
ABBA
shall the hag evil die with the child of good
or propagate again her loath è d kind
thronging the cells of the diseased mind
hateful with hanging cheeks , a withered brood
ABBA
though hourly pastured on the salient blood
oh ! that the wind which bloweth cold or heat
would shatter and o'erbear the brazen beat
of their broad vans , and in the solitude
ABBA
i thought our love at full , but i did err
joy 's wreath drooped o'er mine eyes ; i could not see
that sorrow in our happy world must be
love 's deepest spokesman and interpreter
ABBA
but , as a mother feels her child first stir
under her heart , so felt i instantly
deep in my soul another bond to thee
thrill with that life we saw depart from her
ABBA
o mother of our angel child ! twice dear
death knits as well as parts , and still , i wis
her tender radiance shall infold us here
even as the light , borne up by inward bliss
ABAB
“ i , if i perish , perish ” — esther spake
and bride of life or death she made her fair
in all the lustre of her perfumed hair
and smiles that kindle longing but to slake
ABBA
she put on pomp of loveliness , to take
her husband through his eyes at unaware
she spread abroad her beauty for a snare
harmless as doves and subtle as a snake
ABBA
she trapped him with one mesh of silken hair
she vanquished him by wisdom of her wit
and built her people 's house that it should stand
if i might take my life so in my hand
AABB
while the long night extends her sable reign
around patroclus mourn ’ d the grecian train
stern in superior grief pelides stood
those slaughtering arms , so used to bathe in blood
AABB
now clasp his clay cold limbs : then gushing start
the tears , and sighs burst from his swelling heart
the lion thus , with dreadful anguish stung
roars through the desert , and demands his young
AABB
when the grim savage , to his rifled den
too late returning , snuffs the track of men
and o ’ er the vales and o ’ er the forest bounds
his clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds
AABB
for thou betraying me , i do betray
my nobler part to my gross body 's treason
my soul doth tell my body that he may
triumph in love , flesh stays no farther reason
ABAB
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize , proud of this pride
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
to stand in thy affairs , fall by thy side
ABAB
restore thy tresses to the golden ore
yield cytherea 's son those arks of love
bequeath the heavens the stars that i adore
and to the orient do thy pearls remove
ABAB
yield thy hands ’ pride unto the ivory white
t'arabian odours give thy breathing sweet
restore thy blush unto aurora bright
to thetis give the honour of thy feet
ABAB
let venus have the graces she resigned
and thy sweet voice give back unto the spheres
but yet restore thy fierce and cruel mind
to hyrcan tigers and to ruthless bears
ABAB
i bless the spot , and hour , and circumstance
that wed desire to a thing so high
and say , glad soul , rejoice , for thou and i
of bliss unpaired are made participants
ABBA
hence have come ardent thoughts and waking dreams
that , feeding fancy from so sweet a cup
leave it no lust for gross imaginings
through her the woman 's perfect beauty gleams
ABBA
i think that look of christ might seem to say
“ thou , peter ! art thou then a common stone
which i at last must break my heart upon
for all god 's charge to his high angels may
ABBA
guard my foot better ? did i yesterday
wash thy feet , my beloved , that they should run
quick to deny me , ‘ neath the morning sun
and do thy kisses , like the rest , betray
ABBA
my love is as a fever longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
th ’ uncertain sickly appetite to please
ABAB
my reason the physician to my love
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
hath left me , and i desperate now approve
desire is death , which physic did except
ABAB
past cure i am , now reason is past care
and frantic mad with evermore unrest
my thoughts and my discourse as mad men 's are
at random from the truth vainly expressed
ABAB
these words were utter 'd in a pensive mood
even while mine eyes were on that solemn sight
a contrast and reproach to gross delight
and life 's unspiritual pleasures daily woo 'd
ABBA
but now upon this thought i cannot brood
it is unstable , and deserts me quite
nor will i praise a cloud , however bright
disparaging man 's gifts , and proper food
ABBA
the grove , the sky built temple , and the dome
though clad in colours beautiful and pure
find in the heart of man no natural home
the immortal mind craves objects that endure
ABAB
thou whose spell can raise the dead
bid the prophet 's form appear
“ samuel , raise thy buried head
king , behold the phantom seer
ABAB
earth yawned ; he stood the centre of a cloud
light changed its hue , retiring from his shroud . [ lm
death stood all glassy in his fix é d eye
his hand was withered , and his veins were dry
AABB
his foot , in bony whiteness , glittered there
shrunken and sinewless , and ghastly bare
from lips that moved not and unbreathing frame
like caverned winds , the hollow accents came
AABB
since brass , nor stone , nor earth , nor boundless sea
but sad mortality o'ersways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
ABAB
o how shall summer 's honey breath hold out
against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
ABAB
o fearful meditation , where alack
shall time 's best jewel from time 's chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
ABAB
as that great seer , whose animating rod
taught jacob 's sons their wonder working god
who led thro dreary wastes the murmuring band
and reach 'd the confines of their promised land
AABB
opprest with years , from pisgah 's towering height
on fruitful canaan feasted long his sight
the bliss of unborn nations warm 'd his breast
repaid his toils and sooth 'd his soul to rest
AABB
thus o'er thy subject wave shalt thou behold
far happier realms their future charms unfold
in nobler pomp another pisgah rise
beneath whose foot thy new found canaan lies
AABB
we talk of taxes , and i call you friend
well , such you are ,— but well enough we know
how thick about us root , how rankly grow
those subtle weeds no man has need to tend
ABBA
that flourish through neglect , and soon must send
perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow
our steady senses ; how such matters go
we are aware , and how such matters end
ABBA
prepared to hurl the whizzing lance , to pour
the missive flame , or dart the arrowy shower
young eric the selected squadron led
count bernheim 's son , in camps and contests bred
AABB
a fiery spirit , never at a stay
with martial projects teeming night and day
alike by terror , pity , and remorse
untouch 'd , he held , thro ’ crimes , his fearless course
AABB
their wings in passing . thou , bethink thee , art
a guest for queens to social pageantries
with gages from a hundred brighter eyes
than tears even can make mine , to play thy part
ABBA
of chief musician . what hast thou to do
with looking from the lattice lights at me
a poor , tired , wandering singer , singing through
the dark , and leaning up a cypress tree
ABAB
above the ruin of god 's holy place
where man forsaken lay the bleeding rood
whose hands , when men had craved substantial food
gave not , nor folded when they cried , embrace
ABBA
and , sick with all those centuries of tears
shed in the penance for factitious woe
once more i saw the nations at her feet
for love shone in their eyes , and in their ears
ABBA
one judges as the weather dictates ; right
the poem is at noon , and wrong at night
another judges by a surer gage
an author 's principles , or parentage
AABB
since his great ancestors in flanders fell
the poem doubtless must be written well
another judges by the writer 's look
another judges , for he bought the book
AABB
some judge , their knack of judging wrong to keep
some judge , because it is too soon to sleep
thus all will judge , and with one single aim
to gain themselves , not give the writer , fame
AABB
a few spare guineas may the conquest make
i love the treachery for treachery 's sake
and when her wounded honour jealous grows
i 'll cut away ten thousand oaths and vows
AABB
and tell my comrades , with a manly stride
how i , a girl out witten and out lied
such was not herbert — he had never known
love 's genuine smiles , nor suffer 'd from his frown
AABB
and as to that most honourable part
of planting daggers in a parent 's heart
a novice quite :— he past his hours away
free as a bird and buxom as the day
AABB
dear chorister , who from those shadows sends
ere that the blushing morn dare show her light
such sad lamenting strains , that night attends
become all ear , stars stay to hear thy plight
ABAB
if one whose grief even reach of thought transcends
who ne'er , not in a dream , did taste delight
may thee importune who like care pretends
and seems to joy in woe , in woe 's despite
ABAB
tell me ( so may thou fortune milder try
and long , long sing ) for what thou thus complains
since , winter gone , the sun in dappled sky
now smiles on meadows , mountains , woods , and plains
ABAB
i could not think of thee as piec è d rot
yet such thou wert , for thou hadst been long dead
yet thou liv ’ dst entire in my seeing thought
and what thou wert in me had never fled
ABAB
nay , i had fixed the moments of thy beauty
thy ebbing smile , thy kiss ’ s readiness
and memory had taught my heart the duty
to know thee ever at that deathlessness
ABAB
but when i came where thou wert laid , and saw
the natural flowers ignoring thee sans blame
and the encroaching grass , with casual flaw
framing the stone to age where was thy name
ABAB
wonder it is and pity is't that she
in whom all beauty 's treasure we may find
that may unrich the body and the mind
towards the poor should use no charity
ABBA
my love has gone a begging unto thee
and if that beauty had not been more kind
that pity , long ere this he had been pined
but beauty is content his food to be
ABBA
o pity have when such poor orphans beg
love , naked boy , hath nothing on his back
and though he wanteth neither arm nor leg
yet maimed he is sith he his sight doth lack
ABAB
all are but parts of one stupendous whole
whose body nature is , and god the soul
that , changed through all , and yet in all the same
great in the earth , as in th ’ ethereal frame
AABB
warms in the sun , refreshes in the breeze
glows in the stars , and blossoms in the trees
lives through all life , extends through all extent
spreads undivided , operates unspent
AABB
breathes in our soul , informs our mortal part
as full , as perfect , in a hair as heart
as full , as perfect , in vile man that mourns
as the rapt seraph that adores and burns
AABB
what it is to breathe and live without life
how to be pale with anguish , red with fear
t'have peace abroad , and nought within but strife
wish to be present , and yet shun t'appear
ABAB
how to be bold far off , and bashful near
how to think much , and have no words to speak
to crave redress , yet hold affliction dear
to have affection strong , a body weak
ABAB
never to find , yet evermore to seek
and seek that which i dare not hope to find
t'affect this life and yet this life disleek
grateful t'another , to myself unkind
ABAB
o nightingale that on yon bloomy spray
warblest at eve , when all the woods are still
thou with fresh hope the lover 's heart dost fill
while the jolly hours lead on propitious may
ABBA
thy liquid notes that close the eye of day
first heard before the shallow cuckoo 's bill
portend success in love . o , if jove 's will
have linked that amorous power to thy soft lay
ABBA
now timely sing , ere the rude bird of hate
foretell my hopeless doom , in some grove nigh
as thou from year to year hast sung too late
for my relief , yet hadst no reason why
ABAB
weary with toil , i haste me to my bed
the dear respose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind , when body 's work 's expired
ABAB
for then my thoughts ( from far where i abide
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
ABAB
save that my soul 's imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
which like a jewel ( hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous , and her old face new
ABAB
for if alone thou think to waft my love
her cold is such as can the sea command
and frozen ice shall let thy boat to move
nor can thy forces row it from the land
ABAB
but if thou friendly both at once shalt take
thyself mayst rest . for why ? my sighs will blow
our cold and heat so sweet a thaw shall make
as that thy boat without thy help shall row
ABAB
then will i sit and glut me on those eyes
wherewith my life my eyes could never fill
thus from my boat that comfort shall arise
the want whereof my life and hope did kill
ABAB
if then , on thee is found no crimson stain
of god 's own lamb on bloody calvary slain
if thou art resting not beneath the blood
of that one sacrifice ordained of god
AABB
where wilt thou fly ?— where hide thyself away
from the dread reck'ning of the judgment day
if resting ‘ neath the blood for sinners spilt
look up !— the judge himself has borne thy guilt
AABB
many in aftertimes will say of you
“ he loved her ” — while of me what will they say
not that i loved you more than just in play
for fashion 's sake as idle women do
ABBA
even let them prate ; who know not what we knew
of love and parting in exceeding pain
of parting hopeless here to meet again
hopeless on earth , and heaven is out of view
ABBA
but by my heart of love laid bare to you
my love that you can make not void nor vain
love that foregoes you but to claim anew
beyond this passage of the gate of death
ABAB
long time a child , and still a child , when years
had painted manhood on my check , was i
for yet i lived like one not born to die
a thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears
ABBA
no hope i needed , and i knew no fears
but sleep , though sweet , is only sleep ; and waking
i waked to sleep no more ; at once o'ertaking
the vanguard of my age , with all arrears
ABBA
of duty on my back . nor child , nor man
nor youth , nor sage , i find my head is gray
for i have lost the race i never ran
a rathe december blights my lagging may
ABAB
then gan that nation , th'earths new giant brood
to dart abroad the thunderbolts of warre
and , beating downe these walls with furious mood
into her mothers bosome , all did marre
ABAB
was this his coming ! i had hoped to see
a scene of wondrous glory , as was told
of some great god who in a rain of gold
broke open bars and fell on danae
ABBA
or a dread vision as when semele
sickening for love and unappeased desire
prayed to see god 's clear body , and the fire
caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly
ABBA
with such glad dreams i sought this holy place
and now with wondering eyes and heart i stand
before this supreme mystery of love
some kneeling girl with passionless pale face
ABBA
why are we by all creatures waited on
why do the prodigal elements supply
life and food to me , being more pure than i
simpler , and further from corruption
ABBA
weaker i am , woe 's me ! and worse than you
you have not sinned , nor need be timorous
but wonder at a greater , for to us
created nature doth these things subdue
ABBA
the bubbling brook doth leap when i come by
because my feet find measure with its call
the birds know when the friend they love is nigh
for i am known to them , both great and small
ABAB
the flower that on the lonely hillside grows
expects me there when spring its bloom has given
and many a tree and bush my wanderings knows
and e'en the clouds and silent stars of heaven
ABAB
for he who with his maker walks aright
shall be their lord as adam was before
his ear shall catch each sound with new delight
each object wear the dress that then it wore
ABAB
it is not death which wretched men call dying
but that is very death which i endure
when my coy looking nymph , her grace envying
by fatal frowns my domage doth procure
ABAB
‘ tis neither love the son , nor love the mother
which lovers praise and pray to ; but that love is
which she in eye and i in heart do smother
then muse not though i glory in my miss
ABAB
venemous tongue , tipt with vile adders sting
of that self kynd with which the furies fell
their snaky heads doe combe , from which a spring
of poysoned words and spightfull speeches well
ABAB
let all the plagues and horrid paines of hell
upon thee fall for thine accursed hyre
that with false forged lyes , which thou didst tell
in my true love did stirre up coles of yre
ABAB
the sparkes whereof let kindle thine own fyre
and , catching hold on thine own wicked bed
consume thee quite , that didst with guile conspire
in my sweet peace such breaches to have bred
ABAB
his fellow chiefs inhale the hero 's flame
nerves of his arm and partners in his fame
phillips , with treasured thunders poised and wheel 'd
in brazen tubes , prepares to rake the field
AABB
the trench tops darken with the sable rows
and , tipt with fire , the waving match rope glows
there gallant reidesel in german guise
and specht and breyman , prompt for action , rise
AABB
his savage hordes the murderous johnson leads
files thro the woods and treads the tangled weeds
shuns open combat , teaches where to run
skulk , couch the ambush , aim the hunter 's gun
AABB
triumphant arcks , spyres neighbours to the skie
that you to see doth th'heaven it selfe appall
alas ! by little ye to nothing flie
the peoples fable , and the spoyle of all
ABAB
lo ! in the west , fast fades the lingering light
and day 's last vestige takes its silent flight
no more is heard the woodman 's measured stroke
which with the dawn from yonder dingle broke
AABB
no more , hoarse clamouring o'er the uplifted head
the crows assembling seek their wind rock 'd bed
still 'd is the village hum — the woodland sounds
have ceased to echo o'er the dewy grounds
AABB
and general silence reigns , save when below
the murmuring trent is scarcely heard to flow
and save when , swung by ‘ nighted rustic late
oft , on its hinge , rebounds the jarring gate
AABB
dream footsteps wandering past us in our sleep
a restless presence stirring with the light
the cry of waters where the snow was white
a violet 's whisper where dead leaves lay deep
ABBA
the dim wood 's music makes a sudden leap
broken notes , blending in a wild delight
and lo ! the whole world changes in our sight
promise is ended — we must turn and reap
ABBA
fulfilment , for the spring with all her wealth
is with us , and compels us to her will
yet if the sun dawn we should shun by stealth
yearning for shadows and the darkened hours
ABAB
if the dull substance of my flesh were thought
injurious distance should not stop my way
for then despite of space i would be brought
from limits far remote , where thou dost stay
ABAB
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land
as soon as think the place where he would be
ABAB
but ah , thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
but that so much of earth and water wrought
i must attend , time 's leisure with my moan
ABAB
oh , my beloved , have you thought of this
how in the years to come unscrupulous time
more cruel than death , will tear you from my kiss
and make you old , and leave me in my prime
ABAB
how you and i , who scale together yet
a little while the sweet , immortal height
no pilgrim may remember or forget
as sure as the world turns , some granite night
ABAB
shall lie awake and know the gracious flame
gone out forever on the mutual stone
and call to mind that on the day you came
i was a child , and you a hero grown
ABAB
thou woldest been a trede foul a right
for , if thou have corage as thou hast might
thee were nede of hennes , as i wene
ya , mo than seven tymes seventene
AABB
but first the monarch , so polite
asked mr. whitbread if he 'd be a knight
unwilling in the list to be enrolled
whitbread contemplated the knights of peg
AABB
then to his generous sovereign made a leg
and said , “ he was afraid he was too old
he thanked however his most gracious king
for offering to make him such a thing
AABB
but , ah ! a different reason ‘ twas i fear
it was not age that bade the man of beer
the proffered honor of the monarch shun
the tale of margaret 's knife , and royal fright
AABB
on ! leave the past to bury its own dead
the past is naught to us , the present all
what need of last year 's leaves to strew love 's bed
what need of ghosts to grace a festival
ABAB
i would not , if i could , those days recall
those days not ours . for us the feast is spread
the lamps are lit , and music plays withal
then let us love and leave the rest unsaid
ABAB
this island is our home . around it roar
great gulfs and oceans , channels , straits and seas
what matter in what wreck we reached the shore
so we both reached it ? we can mock at these
ABAB
by the loud winds , though they uprend the sea
even from his central deeps : thine empery
is over all : thou wilt not brook eclipse
thou goest and returnest to his lips
AABB
in midst of mecca 's temple roof , some say
he now hangs without touch or stay at all
that mahomet is she to whom i pray
may ne'er man pray so ineffectual
ABAB
to this harangue the wary youth replied
in truth , fair lady , i could ne'er decide
to criticise what others round may do
‘ tis not the line i 'd willingly pursue
AABB
and i will freely say , that your discourse
has much surprised me , though ‘ tis void of force
to you it surely never can belong
to say variety in love is wrong
AABB
besides , your sex , and decency , ‘ tis clear
to ev'ry disadvantage you appear
what use this eloquence , and what your aim
such charms alone as your 's could me inflame
AABB
the first time that the sun rose on thine oath
to love me , i looked forward to the moon
to slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon
and quickly tied to make a lasting troth
ABBA
to spoil his song with , and which , snatched in haste
is laid down at the first ill sounding note
i did not wrong myself so , but i placed
a wrong on thee . for perfect strains may float
ABAB
swift , at the word , the herald speeds along
the lofty ramparts , through the martial throng
and finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore
opposed in combat on the dusty shore
AABB
“ ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands
your aid ( said thoos ) peteus ’ son demands
your strength , united , best may help to bear
the bloody labours of the doubtful war
AABB
thither the lycian princes bend their course
the best and bravest of the hostile force
but if too fiercely , here , the foes contend
at least , let telamon those towers defend
AABB
victorious through failure ! faithful lord
who for twelve angel legions wouldst not pray
from thine own country of eternal day
to shield thee from the lanterned traitor horde
ABBA
making thy one rash servant sheathe his sword
our long retarded legions , on their way
toiling through sands , and shouldering nile 's down sway
to reach thy soldier , keeping at thy word
ABBA
thou sawest foiled — but glorifiedst him
over ten cities giving him thy rule
we will not mourn a star that grew not dim
a soldier child of god gone home from school
ABAB
give me a golden pen , and let me lean
on heap 'd up flowers , in regions clear , and far
bring me a tablet whiter than a star
or hand of hymning angel , when ‘ tis seen
ABBA
the silver strings of heavenly harp atween
and let there glide by many a pearly car
pink robes , and wavy hair , and diamond jar
and half discovered wings , and glances keen
ABBA
the while let music wander round my ears
and as it reaches each delicious ending
let me write down a line of glorious tone
and full of many wonders of the spheres
ABBA
music to hear , why hear'st thou music sadly
sweets with sweets war not , joy delights in joy
why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly
or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy
ABAB
if the true concord of well tuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee , who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
ABAB
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering
resembling sire , and child , and happy mother
who all in one , one pleasing note do sing
ABAB
what bashful wildness in those crystal eyes
fair zillia !— ah ! more dear to love the gaze
that dwells upon its object , than the rays
of that vague glance , quick , as in summer skies
ABBA
the lightning 's lambent flash , when neither rise
thunder , nor storm .— i mark , while transport plays
warm in thy lover 's eye , what dread betrays
thy throbbing heart :— yet why from his soft sighs
ABBA
fleet'st thou so swift away ?— like the young hind
that bending stands the fountain 's brim beside
when , with a sudden gust , the western wind
rustles among the boughs that shade the tide
ABAB
in those good days when we were young and wise
you spake to music , you with the thoughtful eyes
and god looked down from heaven , pleased to hear
a young man 's song arise so firm and clear
AABB
has fancy died ? the morning star gone cold
why are you silent ? have we grown so old
must i alone keep playing ? will not you
lord of the measures , string your lyre anew
AABB
lover of greece , is this the richest store
you bring us ,— withered leaves and dusty lore
and broken vases widowed of their wine
to brand you pedant while you stand divine
AABB
when poets would be lofty , they commence
with some gay patch of cheap magnificence
of dian 's altar and her grove we read
or rapid streams meandering through the mead
AABB
or grand descriptions of the river rhine
or watery bow , will take up many a line
all in their way good things , but not just now
you 're happy at a cypress , we 'll allow
AABB
but what of that ? you 're painting by command
a shipwrecked sailor , striking out for land
that crockery was a jar when you began
it ends a pitcher : you an artist , man
AABB
upon the steps a woman stands — alone
her lovely face , a trifle paler grown
since last we looked upon its haunting grace
yet still the same child mouth , the radiant eyes
AABB
the dauntless pride , that time cannot efface
before her gazes the earth in beauty lies
awhile she stands and gaze on the scene
with dreamy , far off looks and thoughtful mien
AABB
then wends her way to where the flowers lie
she lingers here , she cannot pass them by
and as she bends to touch each smiling flower
her hands seem gifted with a magic power
AABB
but do thy worst to steal thy self away
for term of life thou art assured mine
and life no longer than thy love will stay
for it depends upon that love of thine
ABAB
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs
when in the least of them my life hath end
i see , a better state to me belongs
than that , which on thy humour doth depend
ABAB
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
o what a happy title do i find
happy to have thy love , happy to die
ABAB
unhappy wit , like most mistaken things
atones not for that envy which it brings
in youth alone its empty praise we boast
but soon the short lived vanity is lost
AABB
like some fair flower the early spring supplies
that gayly blooms but even in blooming dies
what is this wit , which must our cares employ
the owner 's wife that other men enjoy
AABB
then most our trouble still when most admired
and still the more we give the more required
whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease
sure some to vex , but never all to please
AABB
“ andromach è! my soul 's far better part
why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart
no hostile hand can antedate my doom
till fate condemns me to the silent tomb
AABB
fixed is the term to all the race of earth
and such the hard condition of our birth
no force can then resist , no flight can save
all sink alike , the fearful and the brave
AABB
hard to endure : the hoard has been looked at
been gained very grimly ; too grievous the fate that
the prince of the people pricked to come thither
30 i was therein and all of it looked at
AABB
at ephesus , in former times , once shone
a fair , whose charms would dignify a throne
and , if to publick rumour credit ‘ s due
celestial bliss her husband with her knew
AABB
naught else was talked of but her beauteous face
and chastity that adds the highest grace
from ev'ry quarter numbers flocked to see
this belle , regarded as from errors free
AABB
the honour of her sex , and country too
as such , old mothers held her up to view
and wished their offspring 's wives like her to act
the sons desired the very same in fact
AABB
“ thou too , ernestus ! what protecting doom
has guided thee thro ’ fate 's tremendous gloom
unhappy relic of a patriot line
dost thou with all their ancient glory shine
AABB
and , unappall 'd by labour or by fear
lift for thy country the protecting spear
or , wrapt in fetters , and in darkness lost
say , dost thou languish for thy native coast
AABB
perhaps , unnoted , by the tyrant 's eyes
in unknown solitude secure he lies
whate'er his fate , nor terror 's base control
nor hostile bribes , can e'er have moved his soul
AABB
then down her bow the winged iris drives
and swift at priam ’ s mournful court arrives
where the sad sons beside their father ’ s throne
sat bathed in tears , and answer ’ d groan with groan
AABB
and all amidst them lay the hoary sire
( sad scene of woe !) his face his wrapp ’ d attire
conceal ’ d from sight ; with frantic hands he spread
a shower of ashes o ’ er his neck and head
AABB
from room to room his pensive daughters roam
whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome
mindful of those , who late their pride and joy
lie pale and breathless round the fields of troy
AABB
it is not then enough that men who give
the best gifts given of man to man should feel
alive , a snake 's head ever at their heel
small hurt the worms may do them while they live
ABBA
such hurt as scorn for scorn 's sake may forgive
but now , when death and fame have set one seal
on tombs whereat love , grief , and glory kneel
men sift all secrets , in their critic sieve
ABBA
of graves wherein the dust of death might shrink
to know what tongues defile the dead man 's name
with loathsome love , and praise that stings like shame
rest once was theirs , who had crossed the mortal brink
ABBA
how beautiful !— was this not one of eld
that chaos on his boundless bosom held
till earth came forward in a rush of storm
closing his ribs upon her wingless form
AABB
how beautiful !— the very lips do speak
of love , and bid us worship : the pale cheek
seems blushing through the marble — through the snow
and the undrap'ried bosom feels a flow
AABB
of fever on its brightness ; every vein
at the blue pulse swells softly , like a chain
of gentle hills . i would not fling a wreath
of jewels on that brow , to flash beneath
AABB
those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
ABAB
for never resting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there
sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
beauty o'erhyppphensnowed and bareness every where
ABAB
then were not summer 's distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beauty 's effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
ABAB
away they went , and gyges much admired
still more than that : in truth his breast was fired
for when she moved astonishment was great
and ev'ry grace upon her seemed to wait
AABB
emotion to suppress howe'er he tried
since he had promised what he felt to hide
to hold his tongue he wished , but that might raise
suspicions of designs and mystick ways
AABB
exaggeration was the better part
and from the subject he would never start
but fully praised each beauty in detail
without appearing any thing to veil
AABB
the eye was shut in men ; the hearing ear
dull unto deafness ; nought but earthly things
had credence ; and no highest art that flings
a spirit radiance from it , like the spear
ABBA
give man the listening heart , the seeing eye
give life ; let sea derived fountain well
within his spirit , infant waves , to tell
of the far ocean mysteries that lie
ABBA
now gentle sleep hath clos è d up those eyes
which waking kept my boldest thoughts in awe
and free access unto that sweet lip lies
from whence i long the rosy breath to draw
ABAB
methinks no wrong it were if i should steal
from those two melting rubies , one poor kiss
none sees the theft that would the thief reveal
nor rob i her of aught which she can miss
ABAB
nay , should i twenty kisses take away
there would be little sign i had done so
why then should i this robbery delay
oh , she may wake , and therewith angry grow
ABAB
a poor companion whom his friend takes down
to fair surrentum or brundisium 's town
if he makes much of cold , bad roads , and rain
or moans o'er cashhyppphenbox forced and money ta'en
AABB
reminds us of a girl , some artful thing
who cries for a lost bracelet or a ring
with this result , that when she comes to grieve
for real misfortunes , no one will believe
AABB
so , hoaxed by one impostor , in the street
a man wo n't set a cripple on his feet
though he invoke osiris , and appeal
with streaming tears to hearts that will not feel
AABB
but when the dance was o'er , and arm in arm
( the full heart beating ‘ gainst the elbow warm
we pass 'd to the great refreshment hall
where the heap 'd cheese cakes and the comfits small
AABB
lay , like a hive of sunbeams , to burn
around the margin of the negus urn
when my poor quivering hand you finger 'd twice
and , with inquiring accents , whisper 'd “ ice
AABB
water , or cream ? ” i could no more dissemble
but dropp 'd upon the couch all in a tremble
a swimming faintness misted o'er my brain
the corks seem 'd starting from the brisk champagne
AABB
a painter drew the image of the boy
swift love , with wings all naked , and yet blind
with bow and arrows , bent for to destroy
i blamed his skill , and fault i thus did find
ABAB
“ a needless task i see thy cunning take
misled by love , thy fancy thee betrayed
love is no boy , nor blind , as men him make
nor weapons wears , whereof to be affrayed
ABAB
but if thou , love , wilt paint with greatest skill
a love , a maid , a goddess , and a queen
wonder and view at licia 's picture still
for other love the world hath never seen
ABAB
after the fierce midsummer all ablaze
has burned itself to ashes , and expires
in the intensity of its own fires
there come the mellow , mild , st. martin days
ABBA
crowned with the calm of peace , but sad with haze
so after love has led us , till he tires
of his own throes and torments and desires
comes large eyed friendship : with a restful gaze
ABBA
he beckons us to follow , and across
cool , verdant vales we wander free from care
is it a touch of frost lies in the air
why are we haunted with a sense of loss
ABBA
look in my griefs , and blame me not to mourn
from care to care that leads a life so bad
th'orphan of fortune , born to be her scorn
whose clouded brow doth make my days so sad
ABAB
long are their nights whose cares do never sleep
loathsome their days who never sun yet joyed
the impression of her eyes do pierce so deep
that thus i live both day and night annoyed
ABAB
yet since the sweetest root yields fruit so sour
her praise from my complaint i may not part
i love th'effect , the cause being of this power
i 'll praise her face and blame her flinty heart
ABAB
despise the garish presences that flaunt
the obvious possession of today
to wear with me the spectacles that haunt
the optic sense with wraiths of yesterday
ABAB
these cobbled shores through which the traffic streams
have been the stage set of successive towns
where coffined actors postured out their dreams
and harlot folly changed her thousand gowns
ABAB
this corner shop was bull 's head tavern
when names now dead on marble lived in clay
its rooms were like a sanded cavern
where candles made a sallow jest of day
ABAB
i am in love with high far seeing places
that look on plains half sunlight and half storm
in love with hours when from the circling faces
veils pass , and laughing fellowship glows warm
ABAB
you who look on me with grave eyes where rapture
and april love of living burn confessed
the gods are good ! the world lies free to capture
life has no walls . o take me to your breast
ABAB
take me , — be with me for a moment 's span
i am in love with all unveiled faces
i seek the wonder at the heart of man
i would go up to the far seeing places
ABAB
surprised by joy — impatient as the wind
i turned to share the transport — oh ! with whom
but thee , deep buried in the silent tomb
that spot which no vicissitude can find
ABBA
love , faithful love , recalled thee to my mind
but how could i forget thee ? through what power
even for the least division of an hour
have i been so beguiled as to be blind
ABBA
to my most grievous loss ?— that thought 's return
was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore
save one , one only , when i stood forlorn
knowing my heart 's best treasure was no more
ABAB
what , cringe to europe ! band it all in one
stilt its decrepit strength , renew its age
wipe out its debts , contract a loan to wage
its venal battles ,— and , by yon bright sun
ABBA
our god is false , and liberty undone
if slaves have power to win your heritage
look on your country , god 's appointed stage
where man 's vast mind its boundless course shall run
ABBA
for that it was your stormy coast he spread
a fear in winter ; girded you about
with granite hills , and made you strong and dread
let him who fears before the foemen shout
ABAB
friend of the dead , and friend of all my days
even since they cast off boyhood , i salute
the song saluting friends whose songs are mute
with full burnt offerings of clear spirited praise
ABBA
that since our old young years our several ways
have led through fields diverse of flower and fruit
yet no cross wind has once relaxed the root
we set long since beneath the sundawn 's rays
ABBA
the root of trust whence towered the trusty tree
friendship — this only and duly might impel
my song to salutation of your own
more even than praise of one unseen of me
ABBA
at the round earth 's imagined corners blow
your trumpets , angels ! and arise , arise
from death , you numberless infinities
of souls , and to your scattered bodies go
ABBA
but let them sleep , lord ! and me mourn a space
for if above all these my sins abound
‘ tis late to ask abundance of thy grace
when we are there . here on this holy ground
ABAB
then shall your works of art superior rise
your fruits perfume a larger length of skies
canals careering climb your sunbright hills
vein the green slopes and strow their nurturing rills
AABB
thro tunnel 'd heights and sundering ridges glide
rob the rich west of half kenhawa 's tide
mix your wide climates , all their stores confound
and plant new ports in every midland mound
AABB
your lawless missisippi , now who slimes
and drowns and desolates his waste of climes
ribb 'd with your dikes , his torrent shall restrain
and ask your leave to travel to the main
AABB
one might believe that natural miseries
had blasted france , and made of it a land
unfit for men ; and that in one great band
her sons were bursting forth , to dwell at ease
ABBA
but ‘ tis a chosen soil , where sun and breeze
shed gentle favors ; rural works are there
and ordinary business without care
spot rich in all things that can soothe and please
ABBA
how piteous then that there should be such dearth
of knowledge ; that whole myriads should unite
to work against themselves such fell despite
should come in phrenzy and in drunken mirth
ABBA
we lack , yet cannot fix upon the lack
not this , nor that ; yet somewhat , certainly
we see the things we do not yearn to see
around us : and what see we glancing back
ABBA
lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack
hopes that were never ours yet seemed to be
for which we steered on life 's salt stormy sea
braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack
ABBA
if thus to look behind is all in vain
and all in vain to look to left or right
why face we not our future once again
launching with hardier hearts across the main
AABB
because i feel that , in the heavens above
the angels , whispering to one another
can find , among their burning terms of love
none so devotional as that of “ mother
ABAB
therefore by that dear name i long have called you
you who are more than mother unto me
and fill my heart of hearts , where death installed you
in setting my virginia 's spirit free
ABAB
my mother — my own mother , who died early
was but the mother of myself ; but you
are mother to the one i loved so dearly
and thus are dearer than the mother i knew
ABAB
as some poor starveling at a palace gate
sees curtained gleams from banquet litten halls
hears song out ringing from the festal walls
scents viands that shall princely palates sate
ABBA
yet in the outer gloom may only wait
crouched in the cold , thrice thankful for some least
mean morsel flung him from the plenteous feast
poor bondman to the ball and chain of fate
ABBA
what wonder strikes the curious , while he views
the black ant 's city , by a rotten tree
or woodland bank ! in ignorance we muse
pausing , annoyed ,— we know not what we see
ABAB
such government and thought there seem to be
some looking on , and urging some to toil
dragging their loads of bent stalks slavishly
and what 's more wonderful , when big loads foil
ABAB
one ant or two to carry , quickly then
a swarm flock round to help their fellow men
surely they speak a language whisperingly
too fine for us to hear ; and sure their ways
AABB
yet , being so chill 'd , do we not chide the sun
and say he wilful hides his face away
say ‘ tis his will makes the world drear and dun
and takes the golden glory from the day
ABAB
the envious rack we rather should reproach
that comes betwixt us in despite of him
rebellious powers , that on his reign encroach
and , black themselves , his brightness joy to dim
ABAB
so when the troubling mischiefs of the time
or baser minds , bent upon marring thee
stole moments of thy favour , then my rhyme
slander 'd thy love and slurr 'd thy constancy
ABAB
vii . and how shall he whose mission is to bring
the soul to worship at its rightful shrine
seeing in beauty what is most divine
give out the mightiest impulse , and thus fling
ABBA
his soul into the future , scattering
the living seed of wisdom ? shall there shine
from underneath his hand a matchless line
of high earth beauties , till the wide world ring
ABBA
with the far clang that tells a missioned soul
kneeling to homage all about his feet
alas for such a gift were this the whole
the only bread of life men had to eat
ABAB
clear as of old the great voice rings to day
while sherwood 's oak leaves twine with aldworth 's bay
the voice of him the master and the sire
of one whole age and legion of the lyre
AABB
who sang his morning song when coleridge still
uttered dark oracles from highgate hill
and with new launch è d argosies of rhyme
gilds and makes brave this sombreing tide of time
AABB
far be the hour when lesser brows shall wear
the laurel glorious from that wintry hair
when he , the sovereign of our lyric day
in charon 's shallop must be rowed away
AABB
where is the painter who shall paint for you
my austral brothers , with a pencil steeped
in hues of truth , the weather smitten crew
who gazed on unknown shores — a thoughtful few
AABB
what time the heart of their great leader leaped
till he was faint with pain of longing ? new
and wondrous sights on each and every hand
like strange supernal visions , grew and grew
ABAB
until the rocks and trees , and sea and sand
danced madly in the tear bewildered view
and from the surf a fierce , fantastic band
of startled wild men to the hills withdrew
ABAB
still , resignation was my dearest friend
and reason pointed to a glorious end
with anxious sighs , a parent 's hopes and pride
i wish 'd to live — i trust i could have died
AABB
but winter 's clouds pursu 'd their stormy way
and march brought sunshine with the length'ning day
and bade my heart arise , that morn and night
now throbb 'd with irresistible delight
AABB
delightful ‘ twas to leave disease behind
and feel the renovation of the mind
to lead abroad upborne on pleasure 's wing
our children , midst the glories of the spring
AABB
the frog half fearful jumps across the path
and little mouse that leaves its hole at eve
nimbles with timid dread beneath the swath
my rustling steps awhile their joys deceive
ABAB
till past ,— and then the cricket sings more strong
and grasshoppers in merry moods still wear
the short night weary with their fretting song
up from behind the molehill jumps the hare
ABAB
cheat of his chosen bed , and from the bank
the yellowhammer flutters in short fears
from off its nest hid in the grasses rank
and drops again when no more noise it hears
ABAB
what say'st thou , dobbin ? what though hounds await
with open jaws the moment of thy fate
no better fate attends his public race
his life is misery , and his end disgrace
AABB
then freely bear thy burden to the mill
obey but one short law ,... thy driver 's will
affection , to thy memory ever true
shall boast of mighty loads that dobbin drew
AABB
and back to childhood shall the mind with pride
recount thy gentleness in many a ride
to pond , or field , or village fair , when thou
held'st high thy braided mane and comely brow
AABB
“ let her be free and natural as the flowers
that smile and nod throughout the summer hours
let her rejoice in all the joys of youth
but first impress upon her mind this truth
AABB
no lasting happiness is e'er attained
save when the heart some other seeks to please
the cup of selfish pleasures soon is drained
and full of gall and bitterness the lees
ABAB
next to her god , teach her to love her land
in her young bosom light the patriot 's flame
until the heart within her shall expand
with love and fervor at her country 's name
ABAB
daughter of her whose face , and lofty name
prenuptial , of old states and cities speak
where lands of wine look north to peak on peak
of the overwatching alps : through her , you claim
ABBA
kinship with vanished power , unvanished fame
and midst a world grown colorless and bleak
i see the blood of doges in your cheek
and in your hair the titian tints of flame
ABBA
daughter of england too , you first drew breath
where our coy springs to our coy summers yield
and you descend from one whose lance and shield
were with the grandsire of elizabeth
ABBA
was time not harsh to you , or was he kind
o pale erinna of the perfect lyre
that he has left no word of singing fire
whereby you waked the dreaming lesbian wind
ABBA
and kindled night along the lyric shore
o girl whose lips erato stooped to kiss
do you go sorrowing because of this
in fields where poets sing forevermore
ABBA
or are you glad and is it best to be
a silent music men have never heard
a dream in all our souls that we may say
“ her voice had all the rapture of the sea
ABBA
the time will come when a diviner flame
shall warm my breast to sing of c æ sar 's fame
meanwhile , permit that my preluding muse
in theban wars an humbler theme may choose
AABB
of furious hate surviving death she sings
a fatal throne to two contending kings
and funeral flames , that , parting wide in air
express the discord of the souls they bear
AABB
of towns dispeopled , and the wandering ghosts
of kings unburied in the wasted coasts
when dirce 's fountain blush 'd with grecian blood
and thetis , near ismenos ’ swelling flood
AABB
great emperor peacemaker ! well hast , thou done
to link to thy long list of victories won
this bloodless one , where all alike contend
with cultured courtesy , as friend with friend
AABB
to help the fallen , bid rude passions cease
through moral suasion , and re throne blest peace
and thou , disraeli , pillar of the state
with the proud flush of triumph now elate
AABB
well hast thou earned thy laurels , nobly won
thy queen 's and country 's verdict of “ well done
for with far seeing mind , unflinching skill
rare tact and talent , calm , consummate skill
AABB
he walked with god amid the multitude
no threats or smiles could his firm soul divide
from that beloved presence at his side
whose still small voice silenced earth 's noises rude
ABBA
the fairer riddles come from out the night
the richer is the world his arms enclose
the broader stream the sea with which he flows
the weaker , too , is destiny 's blind might
ABBA
through ever purer forms , and purer powers
through ever higher heights , and fairer grace
at length , arrived at the ripe goal of time
yet one more inspiration all sublime
AABB
from fairest creatures we desire increase
that thereby beauty 's rose might never die
but as the riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
ABAB
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
feed'st thy light 's flame with self substantial fuel
making a famine where abundance lies
thy self thy foe , to thy sweet self too cruel
ABAB
well , as soon as a few weeks was over and gone
the terrible day iv the thrial kem on
there was sich a crowd there was scarce room to stand
the sodgers on guard , the dhragoons sword in hand
AABB
an ’ the court house so full that the people were bothered
attorneys an ’ criers were just upon smothered
an ’ counsellers almost gev over for dead
the jury sat up in their box overhead
AABB
an ’ the judge on the bench so detarmined an ’ big
with his gown on his back , and an illigent wig
then silence was called , and the minute ‘ twas said
the court was as still as the heart of the dead
AABB
lyke as a ship , that through the ocean wyde
by conduct of some star doth make her way
whenas a storm hath dimd her trusty guyde
out of her course doth wander far astray
ABAB
so i , whose star , that wont with her bright ray
me to direct , with cloudes is over cast
doe wander now in darknesse and dismay
through hidden perils round about me plast
ABAB
yet hope i well that , when this storme is past
my helice *, the lodestar of ray lyfe
will shine again , and looke on me at last
with lovely light to cleare my cloudy grief
ABAB
arm ! arm ! that mandate on each wind is whirled
let no man hesitate or look askance
for from the devastated homes of france
and ruined belgium the cry is hurled
ABBA
why , christ himself would keep peace banners furled
were he among us , till , with lifted lance
he saw the hosts of righteousness advance
to purify the temples of the world
ABBA
there is no safety on the earth to day
for any sacred thing , or clean , or fair
nor can there be , until men rise and slay
the hydra headed monster in his lair
ABAB
when mourn the dark winds o'er the lonely plain
and from pale noon sinks , ere the fifth cold hour
the transient light , imagination 's power
with knowledge , and with science in her train
ABBA
not unpropitious hyems ’ icy reign
perceives ; since in the deep and silent lour
high themes the rapt concent'ring thoughts explore
freed from external pleasure 's glittering chain
ABBA
then most the understanding 's culture pays
luxuriant harvest , nor shall folly bring
her aids obtrusive .— then , with ardent gaze
the ingenious to their rich resources spring
ABAB
by this the widow had unbarr 'd the door
and chanticleer went strutting out before
with royal courage , and with heart so light
as show 'd he scorned the visions of the night
AABB
now roaming in the yard , he spurn 'd the ground
and gave to partlet the first grain he found
then often feather 'd her with wanton play
and trod her twenty times ere prime of day
AABB
and took by turns , and gave , so much delight
her sisters pined with envy at the sight
he chuck 'd again , when other corns he found
and scarcely deign 'd to set a foot to ground
AABB
seven sweet singing birds up in a tree
seven swift sailing ships white upon the sea
seven bright weather cocks shining in the sun
seven slim race horses ready for a run
AABB
seven gold butterflies , flitting overhead
seven red roses blowing in a garden bed
seven white lilies , with honey bees inside them
seven round rainbows with clouds to divide them
AABB
seven pretty little girls with sugar on their lips
seven witty little boys , whom everybody tips
seven nice fathers , to call little maids joys
seven nice mothers , to kiss the little boys
AABB
his shadow to narcissus well presented
how fair he was by such attractive love
so if thou would'st thyself thy beauty prove
vulgar breath mirrors might have well contented
ABBA
and to their prayers eternally consented
oaths , vows and sighs , if they believe might move
but more thou forc'st , making my pen approve
thy praise to all , least any had dissented
ABBA
when this hath wrought , thou which before wert known
but unto some , of all art now required
and thine eyes ’ wonders wronged , because not shown
the world , with daily orisons desired
ABAB
he ceas 'd ; and old alethes took the word
“ our country gods , in whom our trust we place
will yet from ruin save the trojan race
while we behold such dauntless worth appear
ABBA
in dawning youth , and souls so void of fear
then into tears of joy the father broke
each in his longing arms by turns he took
panted and paus 'd ; and thus again he spoke
ABAB
“ ye brave young men , what equal gifts can we
in recompense of such desert , decree
the greatest , sure , and best you can receive
the gods and your own conscious worth will give
AABB
and is not earth thy living picture , where
thou utterest beauty , simple and profound
in the same form by wondrous union bound
where one may see the first step of the stair
ABBA
and not the next , for brooding vapours there
and god is well content the starry round
should wake the infant 's inarticulate sound
or lofty song from bursting heart of prayer
ABBA
and so all men of low or lofty mind
who in their hearts hear thy unspoken word
have lessons low or lofty , to their kind
in these thy living shows of beauty , lord
ABAB
like as to make our appetite more keen
with eager compounds we our palate urge
as to prevent our maladies unseen
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
ABAB
even so being full of your ne'erhyppphencloying sweetness
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
to be diseased ere that there was true needing
ABAB
thus policy in love t ’ anticipate
the ills that were not , grew to faults assured
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
ABAB
here pock marked black beard covenanted bonnet
to slit the dons ’ throats at st. augustine
and bussed light ladies , unknown to this sonnet
whose names , no doubt , would rime with magdalene
ABAB
and english parsons , who had lost their fames
sat tippling wine as spicy as their joke
larding bald texts with bets on cocking mains
and whiffing pipes churchwardens used to smoke
ABAB
here macaronis , hands a droop with laces
dealt knave to knave in picquet or é cart é,
in coats no whit less scarlet than their faces
while bullies hiccuped healths to king and party
ABAB
whoever thinks a faultless piece to see
thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be
in every work regard the writer 's end
since none can compass more than they intend
AABB
and if the means be just , the conduct true
applause , in spite of trivial faults , is due
as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit
t ’ avoid great errors , must the less commit
AABB
neglect the rules each verbal critic lays
for not to know some trifles , is a praise
most critics , fond of some subservient art
still make the whole depend upon a part
AABB
the winter wind is raving fierce and shrill
and chides with angry moan the frosty skies
the white stars gaze with sleepless gorgon eyes
that freeze the earth in terror fixed and still
ABBA
we reck not of the wild night 's gloom and chill
housed from its rage , dear friend ; and fancy flies
lured by the hand of beckoning memories
back to those summer evenings on the hill
ABBA
where we together watched the sun go down
beyond the gold washed uplands , while his fires
touched into glittering life the vanes and spires
piercing the purpling mists that veiled the town
ABBA
the dame , it is true , would mutter “ shocking
and give her head a sorrowful rocking
and make a clucking with palate and tongue
like the call of partlet to gather her young
AABB
a sound , when human , that always proclaims
at least a thousand pities and shames
but still the darker the tale of sin
like certain folks , when calamities burst
AABB
i grieve not that ripe knowledge takes away
the charm that nature to my childhood wore
for , with that insight , cometh , day by day
a greater bliss than wonder was before
ABAB
the real doth not clip the poet 's wings
to win the secret of a weed 's plain heart
reveals some clue to spiritual things
and stumbling guess becomes firm footed art
ABAB
flowers are not flowers unto the poet 's eyes
their beauty thrills him by an inward sense
he knows that outward seemings are but lies
or , at the most , but earthly shadows , whence
ABAB
pride , the first peer , and president of hell
to his share , spain , the largest province fell
the subtle prince thought fittest to bestow
on these the golden mines of mexico
AABB
with all the silver mountains of peru
wealth which in wise hands would the world undo
because he knew their genius was such
too lazy and too haughty to be rich
AABB
so proud a people , so above their fate
that , if reduced to beg , they 'll beg in state
lavish of money , to be counted brave
and proudly starve , because they scorn to save
AABB
“ ’ tis true ( the cloud compelling power replies
this day we call the council of the skies
in care of human race ; even jove ’ s own eye
sees with regret unhappy mortals die
AABB
far on olympus ’ top in secret state
ourself will sit , and see the hand of fate
work out our will . celestial powers ! descend
and as your minds direct , your succour lend
AABB
to either host . troy soon must lie o ’ erthrown
if uncontroll ’ d achilles fights alone
their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes
what can they now , if in his rage he rise
AABB
through the hushed street , along the silent plain
the spectral future leads its mourning train
dark with the shadows of uncounted bands
where man 's white lips and woman 's wringing hands
AABB
track the still burden , rolling slow before
that love and kindness can protect no more
the smiling babe that , called to mortal strife
shuts its meek eyes and drops its little life
AABB
the drooping child who prays in vain to live
and pleads for help its parent cannot give
the pride of beauty stricken in its flower
the strength of manhood broken in an hour
AABB
by no dry death another king goes down
the way of kings . yet may no free man 's voice
for stern compassion and deep awe , rejoice
that one sign more is given against the crown
ABBA
that one more head those dark red waters drown
which rise round thrones whose trembling equipoise
is propped on sand and bloodshed and such toys
as human hearts that shrink at human frown
ABBA
the name writ red on polish earth , the star
that was to outshine our england 's in the far
east heaven of empire — where is one that saith
proud words now , prophesying of this white czar
AABB
the speedy council at his word adjourn ’ d
to their black vessels all the greeks return ’ d
achilles sought his tent . his train before
march ’ d onward , bending with the gifts they bore
AABB
those in the tents the squires industrious spread
the foaming coursers to the stalls they led
to their new seats the female captives move
briseis , radiant as the queen of love
AABB
slow as she pass ’ d , beheld with sad survey
where , gash ’ d with cruel wounds , patroclus lay
prone on the body fell the heavenly fair
beat her sad breast , and tore her golden hair
AABB
with lyre orphean , see a bard explore
the central caverns of the mornless night
where never muse perform 'd harmonious rite
till now !— and lo ! upon the sparry floor
ABBA
advance , to welcome him , each sister power
petra , stern queen , fossilia , cold and bright
and call their gnomes , to marshal in his sight
the gelid incrust , and the veined ore
ABBA
let the world 's sharpness like a clasping knife
shut in upon itself and do no harm
in this close hand of love , now soft and warm
and let us hear no sound of human strife
ABBA
after the click of the shutting . life to life
i lean upon thee , dear , without alarm
and feel as safe as guarded by a charm
against the stab of worldlings , who if rife
ABBA
far be the guilt of homeshed blood from all
on whom , unsought , embroiling dangers fall
still the pale dead revives , and lives to me
to me ! through pity 's eye condemned to see
AABB
remembrance veils his rage , but swells his fate
grieved i forgive , and am grown cool too late
young , and unthoughtful then ; who knows , one day
what ripening virtues might have made their way
AABB
he might have lived till folly died in shame
till kindling wisdom felt a thirst for fame
he might perhaps his country 's friend have proved
both happy , generous , candid , and beloved
AABB
maid with the poppies , must i let thee go
alas , i may not ; thou art likewise dear
i am but human , and thou hast a tear
when she hath nought but splendour , and the glow
ABBA
of a wild energy that mocks the flow
of the poor sympathies which keep us here
lay past thy poppies , and come twice as near
and i will teach thee , and thou too shalt grow
ABBA
and thou shalt walk with me in open day
through the rough thoroughfares with quiet grace
and the wild visaged maid shall lead the way
timing her footsteps to a gentler pace
ABAB
why art thou silent ? is thy love a plant
of such weak fibre that the treacherous air
of absence withers what was once so fair
is there no debt to pay , no boon to grant
ABBA
yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant
bound to thy service with unceasing care
the mind 's least generous wish a mendicant
for naught but what thy happiness could spare
ABAB
speak !— though this soft warm heart , once free to hold
a thousand tender pleasures , thine and mine
be left more desolate , more dreary cold
than a forsaken bird'shyppphennest filled with snow
ABAB
friend , whom thy fourscore winters leave more dear
than when life 's roseate summer on thy cheek
burned in the flush of manhood 's manliest year
lonely , how lonely ! is the snowy peak
ABAB
thy feet have reached , and mine have climbed so near
close on thy footsteps ‘ mid the landscape drear
i stretch my hand thine answering grasp to seek
warm with the love no rippling rhymes can speak
AABB
look backward ! from thy lofty height survey
thy years of toil , of peaceful victories won
of dreams made real , largest hopes outrun
look forward ! brighter than earth 's morning ray
ABBA
to whom the queen ( whilst yet in pensive mind
was in the silent gates of sleep confined
“ o sister to my soul forever dear
why this first visit to reprove my fear
AABB
how in a realm so distant should you know
from what deep source ceaseless sorrows flow
to all my hope my royal lord is lost
his country 's buckler , and the grecian boast
AABB
and with consummate woe to weigh me down
the heir of all his honours and his crown
my darling son is fled ! an easy prey
to the fierce storms , or men more fierce than they
AABB
i would not if i could undo my past
tho ’ for its sake my future is a blank
my past , for which i have myself to thank
for all its faults and follies first and last
ABBA
i would not cast anew the lot once cast
or launch a second ship for one that sank
or drug with sweets the bitterness i drank
or break by feasting my perpetual fast
ABBA
one vast creation , lately borne abroad
cheers the young nations like a nurturing god
breathes thro them all the same wide searching soul
forms , feeds , refines and animates the whole
AABB
guards every ground they gain , and forward brings
glad science soaring on cerulean wings
trims her gay plumes , directs her upward course
props her light pinions and sustains her force
AABB
instructs all men her golden gifts to prize
and catch new glories from her beamful eyes
tis the prolific press ; whose tablet , fraught
by graphic genius with his painted thought
AABB
come , come to bed . the shadows move about
and some one seems to overhear our talk
the fire is low ; the candles flicker out
the ghosts of former tenants want to walk
ABAB
already they are shuffling through the gloom
i felt an old man touch my shoulder blade
once he was married here ; they love this room
he and his woman and the child they made
ABAB
dead , dead , they are , yet some familiar sound
creeping along the brink of happy life
revives their memory from under ground
the farmer and his troublesome old wife
ABAB
in yonder cot , along whose mouldering walls
in many a fold the mantling woodbine falls
the village matron kept her little school
gentle of heart , yet knowing well to rule
AABB
staid was the dame , and modest was her mien
her garb was coarse , yet whole , and nicely clean
her neatly border 'd cap , as lily fair
beneath her chin was pinn 'd with decent care
AABB
and pendent ruffles , of the whitest lawn
of ancient make , her elbows did adorn
faint with old age , and dim were grown her eyes
a pair of spectacles their want supplies
AABB
and on the shore of that salt teary sea
couched in a bed of unseen seeming pleasure
where in imaginary thoughts thy fair self lay
but being waked , robbed of my life 's best treasure
ABAB
the silvery sea weed matted round her bed
and distant surges murmuring o'er her head
high in the flood her azure dome ascends
270 the crystal arch on crystal columns bends
AABB
roof 'd with translucent shell the turrets blaze
and far in ocean dart their colour 'd rays
o'er the white floor successive shadows move
as rise and break the ruffled waves above
AABB
275 around the nymph her mermaid trains repair
and weave with orient pearl her radiant hair
with rapid fins she cleaves the watery way
shoots like a diver meteor up to day
AABB
my love lay sleeping , where birds music made
shutting her eyes , disdainful of the light
the heat was great but greater was the shade
which her defended from his burning sight
ABAB
this cupid saw , and came a kiss to take
sucking sweet nectar from her sugared breath
she felt the touch , and blushed , and did awake
seeing t'was love , which she did think was death
ABAB
she cut his wings and caus è d him to stay
making a vow , he should not thence depart
unless to her the wanton boy could pay
the truest , kindest and most loving heart
ABAB
i saw , or dreamed i saw , her sitting lone
her neck bent like a swan 's , her brown eyes thrown
on some sweet poem — his , i think , who sings
oenone , or the hapless maud : no rings
AABB
flashed from the dainty fingers , which held back
her beautiful blonde hair . ah ! would these black
locks of mine own were mingling with it now
and these warm lips were pressed against her brow
AABB
and , as she turned a page , methought i heard
hush ! could it be ?— a faintly murmured word
it was so softly dwelt on — such a smile
played on her brow and wreathed her lip the while
AABB
thus having spoke , the unknown celestial leads
the footsteps of the duty he treads
and secret moves along the crowded space
unseen of all the rude phaeacian race
AABB
( so pallas order 'd , pallas to their eyes
the mist objected , and condensed the skies
the chief with wonder sees the extended streets
the spreading harbours , and the riding fleets
AABB
he next their princes ’ lofty domes admires
in separate islands , crown 'd with rising spires
and deep entrenchments , and high walls of stone
that gird the city like a marble zone
AABB
oh , solitude ! thou wonder working fay
come nurse my feeble fancy in your arms
though i , and thee , and fancy town pent lay
come , call around , a world of country charms
ABAB
let all this room , these walls dissolve away
and bring me surrey 's fields to take their place
this floor be grass , and draughts as breezes play
yon curtains trees , to wave in summer 's face
ABAB
my ceiling , sky ; my water jug a stream
my bed , a bank , on which to muse and dream
the spell is wrought : imagination swells
my sleeping room to hills , and woods , and dells
AABB
i 'd be concerned in no litigious jar
beloved by all , not vainly popular
whate'er assistance i had power to bring
t ’ oblige my company , or to serve my king
AABB
whene'er they called , i 'd readily afford
my tongue , my pen , my counsel , or my sword
lawsuits i 'd shun , with as much studious care
as i would dens where hungry lions are
AABB
and rather put up injuries , than be
a plague to him who 'd be a plague to me
i value quiet at a price too great
to give for my revenge so dear a rate
AABB
men have i seen , and seen with wonderment
noble in form , “ lift upward and divine
in whom i yet must search , as in a mine
after that soul of theirs , by which they went
ABBA
alive upon the earth . and i have bent
regard on many a woman , who gave sign
god willed her beautiful , when he drew the line
that shaped each float and fold of beauty 's tent
ABBA
her soul , alas , chambered in pigmy space
left the fair visage pitiful — inane
poor signal only of a coming face
when from the penetrale she filled the fane
ABAB
nay , we are children : we will not mature
a blessed gift must seem a theft ; and tears
must storm our eyes when but a joy appears
in drear disguise of sorrow ; and how poor
ABBA
we seem when we are richest ,— most secure
against all poverty the lifelong years
we yet must waste in childish doubts and fears
that , in despite of reason , still endure
ABBA
alas ! the sermon of the rose we will
not wisely ponder ; nor the sobs of grief
lulled into sighs of rapture ; nor the cry
of fierce defiance that again is still
ABBA
but passing this , as from our tale apart
dame partlet was the sovereign of his heart
ardent in love , outrageous in his play
he feather 'd her a hundred times a day
AABB
and she , that was not only passing fair
but was with all discreet , and debonair
resolved the passive doctrine to fulfil
though loth ; and let him work his wicked will
AABB
at board and bed was affable and kind
according as their marriage vow did bind
and as the church 's precept had enjoin 'd
even since she was a se'ennight old , they say
AABB
like as the spotless ermelin distressed
circumpassed round with filth and lothsome mud
pines in her grief , imprisoned to her nest
and cannot issue forth to seek her good
ABAB
so i invironed with a hatefull want
look to the heavens ; the heavens yield forth no grace
i search the earth , the earth i find as scant
i view myself , myself in wofull case
ABAB
heaven nor earth will not , myself cannot make
a way through want to free my soul from care
but i must pine , and in my pining lurk
lest my sad looks bewray me how i fare
ABAB
in robes of tyrian blue the king was drest
a jewelled collar shone upon his breast
a giant ruby glittered in his crown
lord of rich lands and many a splendid town
AABB
in him the glories of an ancient line
of sober kings , who ruled by right divine
were centred ; and to him with loyal awe
the people looked for leadership and law
AABB
ten thousand knights , the safeguard of the land
were like a single sword within his hand
a hundred courts , with power of life and death
proclaimed decrees of justice by his breath
AABB
dark vault of heaven , that greet his daily throne
where flee the glories of your absent sun
ye starry hosts , who kindle from his eye
can you behold him in the western sky
AABB
or if unseen beneath his watery bed
the wearied god reclines his radiant head
when next his morning steps your courts inflame
and seek on earth for young azonto 's name
AABB
then point these ashes , mark the smoky pile
and say the hero suffer 'd with a smile
so shall the power in vengeance view the place
in crimson clothe his terror beaming face
AABB
peter , when thou this pleasant world dost see
believe , thou seest mere dreams and vanity
not real things , but false , and through the air
each where an empty , slipp'ry scene , though fair
AABB
the chirping birds , the fresh woods ’ shady boughs
the leaves ’ shrill whispers , when the west wind blows
the swift , fierce greyhounds coursing on the plains
the flying hare , distress 'd ‘ twixt fear and pains
AABB
the bloomy maid decking with flow'rs her head
the gladsome , easy youth by light love led
and whatsoe'er here with admiring eyes
thou seem'st to see , ‘ tis but a frail disguise
AABB
turgis , count of tortosa came
lord of the city , he bears its name
scathe to the christian to him is best
and in marsil 's presence he joined the rest
AABB
no power shall roland from slaughter save
see the length of my peerless glaive
that with durindana to cross i go
and who the victor , ye then shall know
AABB
luck to the craft that bears this name of mine
good fortune follow with her golden spoon
the glazed hat and tarry pantaloon
and wheresoe'er her keel shall cut the brine
ABBA
cod , hake and haddock quarrel for her line
shipped with her crew , whatever wind may blow
or tides delay , my wish with her shall go
fishing by proxy . would that it might show
AABB
at need her course , in lack of sun and star
where icebergs threaten , and the sharp reefs are
lift the blind fog on anticosti 's lee
and avalon 's rock ; make populous the sea
AABB
when all my trivial rhymes are blotted out
vanished our days , so precious and so few
if some should wonder what we were about
and what the little happenings we knew
ABAB
i wish that they might know how , night by night
my pencil , heavy in the sleepy hours
sought vainly for some gracious way to write
how much this love is ours , and only ours
ABAB
how many evenings , as you drowsed to sleep
i read to you by tawny candle glow
and watched you down the valley dim and deep
where poppies and the april flowers grow
ABAB
still flies achilles , but before his eyes
still swift scamander rolls where ’ er he flies
not all his speed escapes the rapid floods
the first of men , but not a match for gods
AABB
oft as he turn ’ d the torrent to oppose
and bravely try if all the powers were foes
so oft the surge , in watery mountains spread
beats on his back , or bursts upon his head
AABB
yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves
and still indignant bounds above the waves
tired by the tides , his knees relax with toil
wash ’ d from beneath him slides the slimy soil
AABB
vast chaos , of eld , was god 's dominion
‘ twas his beloved child , his own first born
and he was aged ere the thought of morn
shook the sheer steeps of dim oblivion
ABBA
then all the works of darkness being done
through countless aeons hopelessly forlorn
out to the very utmost verge and bourne
god at the last , reluctant , made the sun
ABBA
he loved his darkness still , for it was old
he grieved to see his eldest child take flight
and when his fiat lux the death knell tolled
as the doomed darkness backward by him rolled
AABB
“ twas thou , bold hector ! whose resistless hand
first seized a ship on that contested strand
the same which dead protesilaus bore
the first that touch ’ d the unhappy trojan shore
AABB
for this in arms the warring nations stood
and bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood
no room to poise the lance or bend the bow
but hand to hand , and man to man , they grow
AABB
wounded , they wound ; and seek each other ’ s hearts
with falchions , axes , swords , and shorten ’ d darts
the falchions ring , shields rattle , axes sound
swords flash in air , or glitter on the ground
AABB
sylvia my heart in wondrous wise alarm 'd
awed without sense , and without beauty charm 'd
but some odd graces and some flights she had
was just not ugly , and was just not mad
AABB
her tongue still ran on credit from her eyes
more pert than witty , more a wit than wise
good nature , she declared it , was her scorn
though ‘ twas by that alone she could be borne
AABB
affronting all , yet fond of a good name
a fool to pleasure , yet a slave to fame
now coy , and studious in no point to fall
now all agog for d —— y at a ball
AABB
with slapstick or sombrero or with cane
the rube , the cowboy or the masher vain
they over act each part . but at the height
of banter and of canter and delight
AABB
the masks fall off for one queer instant there
and show real faces : faces full of care
and desperate longing : love that 's hot or cold
and subtle thoughts , and countenances bold
AABB
one thinking to encrease the joys of life
marries a beautiful young buxom wife
but soon he finds himself grow cloy 'd and weak
nor can he give her half those joys she 'd take
AABB
he now consumptive , pale and meagre grows
while she complaining to her parents goes
says she can n't love him , such a one as he
and now desires she may live sep'rately
AABB
bowed in the firelight 's softly climbing gleam
i sit a shadow , in a shadow 's place
while through the great , grey window vaguely stream
twilight caresses on each pictured face
ABAB
that one hour gone was cold in art 's repose
now each still canvas answers tremblingly
till eyes unveil and living spirit glows
where no light was while the rude day went by
ABAB
and rudest day , that passed so sternly bare
cold as the life that walks without desire
unbeauteous as duty or despair
plucked by a hope that will not set her free
ABAB
shall christ hang on the cross , and we not look
heaven , earth , and hell stood gazing at the first
while christ for long cursed man was counted cursed
christ , god and man , whom god the father strook
ABBA
and shamed and sifted and one while forsook
cry shame upon our bodies we have nursed
in sweets , our souls in pride , our spirits immersed
in wilfulness , our steps run all acrook
ABBA
cry shame upon us ! for he bore our shame
in agony , and we look on at ease
with neither hearts on flame nor cheeks on flame
what hast thou , what have i , to do with peace
ABAB
the sex inclined to follow this advice
about receipts however they were not nice
the entertainment greatly was admired
and pure devotion all their bosoms fired
AABB
a glass of cordial some apart received
good cheer was given , may be well believed
ten youthful dames brisk friar fripart took
gay , airy , and engaging ev'ry look
AABB
who paid with pleasure all the monk could wish
some had fifteen :— some twelve to taste their dish
good friar rock had twenty for his share
and gave such satisfaction to the fair
AABB
the lombard custom was , that when the king
who slept not with his queen , ( a common thing
in other countries too ) , desired to greet
his royal consort , and in bed to meet
AABB
a night gown solely o'er his back he threw
and then proceeded to the interview
knocked softly at the door , on which a fair
who waited on the queen with anxious care
AABB
allowed the prince to enter ; took his light
( which only glimmered in the midst of night
then put it out , and quickly left the room
a little lantern to dispel the gloom
AABB
awake — arise ! all my stormy powers
the earth , the fair earth , again is ours
at my stern approach , pale autumn flings down
in the dust her broken and faded crown
AABB
at my glance the terrified mourner flies
and the earth is filled with her doleful cries
awake !— for the season of flowers is o'er
my white banner unfurl on each northern shore
AABB
ye have slumbered long in my icy chain
ye are free to travel the land and main
spirits of frost ! quit your mountains of snow
will ye longer suffer the streams to flow
AABB
some , foreign writers , some , our own despise
the ancients only , or the moderns prize
thus wit , like faith , by each man is applied
to one small sect , and all are damn 'd beside
AABB
meanly they seek the blessing to confine
and force that sun but on a part to shine
which not alone the southern wit sublimes
but ripens spirits in cold northern climes
AABB
which from the first has shone on ages past
enlights the present , and shall warm the last
though each may feel increases and decays
and see now clearer and now darker days
AABB
whether with freedom , stretched in her own gore
whose pleading hands and suppliant distress
still offer hearts that thirst for righteousness
a glorious cause to strike or perish for
ABBA
where shall a sorrow great enough be sought
for this sad ruin which the fates have wrought
unless the fates themselves should weep and wish
their curbless power had been controlled in this
AABB
for thy loss , worthiest lord , no mourning eye
has flood enough ; no muse nor elegy
enough expression to thy worth can lend
no , though thy sidney had survived his friend
AABB
dead , noble brooke shall be to us a name
of grief and honour still , whose deathless fame
such virtue purchased as makes us to be
unjust to nature in lamenting thee
AABB
his speech the tempest of her grief restored
in all he told she recognized her lord
but when the storm was spent in plenteous showers
a pause inspiriting her languish 'd powers
AABB
“ o thou , ( she cried ,) whom first inclement fate
made welcome to my hospitable gate
with all thy wants the name of poor shall end
henceforth live honour 'd , my domestic friend
AABB
upon a summer 's day love went to swim
and cast himself into a sea of tears
the clouds called in their light , and heaven waxed dim
and sighs did raise a tempest , causing fears
ABAB
the naked boy could not so wield his arms
but that the waves were masters of his might
and threatened him to work far greater harms
if he devis è d not to scape by flight
ABAB
then for a boat his quiver stood instead
his bow unbent did serve him for a mast
whereby to sail his cloth of veil he spread
his shafts for oars on either board he cast
ABAB
he strode along the field , as thus he said
( the sable plumage nodded o ’ er his head
swift through the spacious plain he sent a look
one instant saw , one instant overtook
AABB
the distant band , that on the sandy shore
the radiant spoils to sacred ilion bore
there his own mail unbraced the field bestrow ’ d
his train to troy convey ’ d the massy load
AABB
now blazing in the immortal arms he stands
the work and present of celestial hands
by aged peleus to achilles given
as first to peleus by the court of heaven
AABB
six thousand veterans practised in war 's game
tried men , at killicranky were arrayed
against an equal host that wore the plaid
shepherds and herdsmen .— like a whirlwind came
ABBA
the highlanders , the slaughter spread like flame
and garry , thundering down his mountain road
was stopped , and could not breathe beneath the load
of the dead bodies .— ‘ twas a day of shame
ABBA
for them whom precept and the pedantry
of cold mechanic battle do enslave
o for a single hour of that dundee , [ a
who on that day the word of onset gave
ABAB
“ speak , then , and tell me , sir ganelon
how may roland to death be done
“ through cizra 's pass will the emperor wind
but his rear will linger in march behind
AABB
roland and olivier there shall be
with twenty thousand in company
muster your battle against them then
a hundred thousand heathen men
AABB
till worn and spent be the frankish bands
though your bravest perish beneath their hands
for another battle your powers be massed
roland will sink , overcome at last
AABB
an anthem of a sister choristry
and like a windward murmur of the sea
o'er silver shells , so solemnly it falls
a dying music shrouded in deep walls
AABB
that bury its wild breathings ! and the moon
of glow worm hue , like virgin in sad swoon
lies coldly on the bosom of a cloud
until the elf winds , that are wailing loud
AABB
do minister unto her sickly trance
fanning the life into her countenance
and there are pale stars sparkling , far and few
in the deep chasms of everlasting blue
AABB
not causeless were you christened , gentle flowers
the one of faith , the other fancy 's pride
for she who guides both faith and fancy 's power
in your fair colors wraps her ivory side
ABAB
as one of you hath whiteness without stain
so spotless is my love and never tainted
and as the other shadoweth faith again
such is my lass , with no fond change acquainted
ABAB
and as nor tyrant sun nor winter weather
may ever change sweet amaranthus ’ hue
so she though love and fortune join together
will never leave to be both fair and true
ABAB
“ big joss and little zeno , pray come here
look now — how dreadful ! can i help but fear
madame mahaud was speaker . moonlight there
caressingly enhanced her beauty rare
AABB
making it shine and tremble , as if she
so soft and gentle were of things that be
of air created , and are brought and ta'en
by heavenly flashes . now , she spoke again
AABB
“ certes , ‘ tis heavy purchase of a throne
to pass the night here utterly alone
had you not slyly come to guard me now
i should have died of fright outright i know
AABB
eight hours ’ , ten hours ’ , twelve hours ’ shift
oh , it 's long and long the day is
up before light , and home in the night
that is our share in the desperate fight
AABB
and it 's long and long the day is
backs and arms and heads that ache
eyes over tired and legs that shake
and hearts full nigh to burst and break
AABB
oh , it 's long and long the day is
week in , week out , not a second to spare
but though it should kill us we 'll do our share
for the sake of the lads , who have gone out there
AABB
i stood amazed , and saw my licia shine
fairer than phoebus , in his brightest pride
set forth in colors by a hand divine
where naught was wanting but a soul to guide
ABAB
it was a picture , that i could descry
yet made with art so as it seemed to live
surpassing fair , and yet it had no eye
whereof my senses could no reason give
ABAB
with that the painter bid me not to muse
“ her eyes are shut , but i deserve no blame
for if she saw , in faith , it could not choose
but that the work had wholly been a flame
ABAB
as the bold eagle with fierce sorrow stung
or parent vulture , mourns her ravish 'd young
they cry , they scream , their unfledged brood a prey
to some rude churl , and borne by stealth away
AABB
so they aloud : and tears in tides had run
their grief unfinish 'd with the setting sun
but checking the full torrent in its flow
the prince thus interrupts the solemn woe
AABB
i once may see when years shall wreck my wrong
and golden hairs shall change to silver wire
and those bright rays that kindle all this fire
shall fail in force , their working not so strong
ABBA
then beauty , now the burden of my song
whose glorious blaze the world doth so admire
must yield up all to tyrant time 's desire
then fade those flowers that decked her pride so long
ABBA
when if she grieve to gaze her in her glass
which then presents her whiter withered hue
go you , my verse , go tell her what she was
for what she was , she best shall find in you
ABAB
lo , the poor indian ! whose untutor 'd mind
sees god in clouds , or hears him in the wind
his soul , proud science never taught to stray
far as the solar walk , or milky way
AABB
yet simple nature to his hope has given
behind the cloud topp 'd hill , an humbler heaven
some safer world in depth of woods embraced
some happier island in the watery waste
AABB
where slaves once more their native land behold
no fiends torment , no christians thirst for gold
to be , contents his natural desire
he asks no angel 's wing , no seraph 's fire
AABB
from upland slopes i see the cows file by
lowing , great chested , down the homeward trail
by dusking fields and meadows shining pale
with moon tipped dandelions . flickering high
ABBA
cool night winds creep , and whisper in mine ear
the homely cricket gossips at my feet
from far off pools and wastes of reeds i hear
clear and soft piped , the chanting frogs break sweet
ABAB
an old , mad , blind , despised , and dying king
princes , the dregs of their dull race , who flow
through public scorn ,— mud from a muddy spring
rulers who neither see , nor feel , nor know
ABAB
makes as a two edged sword to all who wield
golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay
religion christless , godless — a book sealed
a senate ,— time 's worst statute , unrepealed
ABAB
i hope and fear , i pray and hold my peace
now freeze my thoughts and straight they fry again
i now admire and straight my wonders cease
i loose my bonds and yet myself restrain
ABAB
this likes me most that leaves me discontent
my courage serves and yet my heart doth fail
my will doth climb whereas my hopes are spent
i laugh at love , yet when he comes i quail
ABAB
the more i strive , the duller bide i still
i would be thralled , and yet i freedom love
i would redress , yet hourly feed mine ill
i would repine , and dare not once reprove
ABAB
while i gazed on that fair one 's cheek , a shade
of thought , or care , stole softly over
like that by a cloud in a summer 's day made
looking down on a field of blossoming clover
ABAB
the rose yet lay on her cheek , but its flush
had something lost of its brilliant blush
and the light in her eye , and the light on the wheels
that marched so calmly round above her
AABB
was a little dimmed — as when evening steals
upon noon 's hot face :— yet one could n't but love her
for she looked like a mother whose first babe lay
rocked on her breast , as she swung all day
AABB
a hilltop sought by every soothing breeze
that loves the melody of murmuring boughs
cool shades , green acreage , and antique house
fronting the ocean and the dawn ; than these
ABBA
old monks built never for the spirit 's ease
cloisters more calm — not cluny nor clairvaux
sweet are the noises from the bay below
and cuckoos calling in the tulip trees
ABBA
here , a yet empty suitor in thy train
beloved poesy , great joy was mine
to while a listless spell of summer days
happier than hoarder in each evening 's gain
ABBA
did i not know a great man 's power and might
in spite of innocence can smother right
colour his villainies to get esteem
and make the honest man the villain seem
AABB
i know it , and the world doth know ‘ tis true
yet i protest if such a man i knew
that might my country prejudice or thee
were he the greatest or the proudest he
AABB
that breathes this day ; if so it might be found
that any good to either might redound
i unappalled , dare in such a case
rip up his foulest crimes before his face
AABB
nay , thou hast lost them both , ” the fisher said
and as he spoke a wondrous light was shed
around his form ; he dropped his garments mean
and in his place the river god was seen
AABB
“ thy vanity hast brought thee in my power
“ and thou shalt pay the forfeit at this hour
“ for thou hast shown thyself a royal fool
“ too proud to angle , and too vain to rule
AABB
“ eager to win in every trivial strife
“ go ! thou shalt fish for minnows all thy life
wrathful , the king the scornful sentence heard
he strove to answer , but he only chirr r ed
AABB
remember , man , ‘ the universal cause
acts not by partial , but by general laws
and makes what happiness we justly call
subsist , not in the good of one , but all
AABB
there 's not a blessing individuals find
but some way leans and hearkens to the kind
no bandit fierce , no tyrant mad with pride
no cavern 'd hermit , rests self satisfied
AABB
who most to shun or hate mankind pretend
seek an admirer , or would fix a friend
abstract what others feel , what others think
all pleasures sicken , and all glories sink
AABB
sol thro ’ white curtains shot a tim'rous ray
and oped those eyes that must eclipse the day
now lap dogs give themselves the rousing shake
and sleepless lovers , just at twelve , awake
AABB
thrice rung the bell , the slipper knock 'd the ground
and the press 'd watch return 'd a silver sound
belinda still her downy pillow prest
her guardian sylph prolong 'd the balmy rest
AABB
‘ twas he had summon 'd to her silent bed
the morning dream that hover 'd o'er her head
a youth more glitt'ring than a birth night beau
( that ev'n in slumber caus 'd her cheek to glow
AABB
waked by the cries , the athenian chief arose
the knightly forms of combat to dispose
and passing through the obsequious guards , he sate
conspicuous on a throne , sublime in state
AABB
there , for the two contending knights he sent
arm 'd cap a pie , with reverence low they bent
he smiled on both , and with superior look
alike their offer 'd adoration took
AABB
the people press on every side to see
their awful prince , and hear his high decree
then signing to their heralds with his hand
they gave his orders from their lofty stand
AABB
the holly bush , a sober lump of green
shines through the leafless shrubs all brown and grey
and smiles at winter be it eer so keen
with all the leafy luxury of may
ABAB
and o it is delicious , when the day
in winter 's loaded garment keenly blows
and turns her back on sudden falling snows
to go where gravel pathways creep between
ABBA
arches of evergreen that scarce let through
a single feather of the driving storm
and in the bitterest day that ever blew
the walk will find some places still and warm
ABAB
stand , thou great bulwark of man 's liberty
thou rock of shelter , rising from the wave
sole refuge to the overwearied brave
who planned , arose , and battled to be free
ABBA
fell , undeterred , then sadly turned to thee
saved the free spirit from their country 's grave
to rise again , and animate the slave
when god shall ripen all things . britons , ye
ABBA
who guard the sacred outpost , not in vain
hold your proud peril ! freemen undefiled
keep watch and ward ! let battlements be piled
around your cliffs ; fleets marshalled , till the main
ABBA
the chief hung up :— the princess soon appeared
her spirits presently our champion cheered
the pirate scarcely had her bosom moved
no tears at least a marked affection proved
AABB
but , by her prayers she pardon sought to gain
for some who were not in the conflict slain
consoled the dying , and lamented those
who , by the sword , had closed their book of woes
AABB
then left the place without the least regret
where such adventures and alarms she 'd met
‘ tis said , indeed , she presently forgot
the two gallants who last became her lot
AABB
where lies the land to which yon ship must go
festively she puts forth in trim array
as vigorous as a lark at break of day
is she for tropic suns , or polar snow
ABBA
what boots the enquiry ? neither friend nor foe
she cares for ; let her travel where she may
she finds familiar names , a beaten way
ever before her , and a wind to blow
ABBA
yet still i ask , what haven is her mark
and , almost as it was when ships were rare
from time to time , like pilgrims , here and there
crossing the waters ; doubt , and something dark
ABBA
the lad most gratefully his thanks returned
his breast with ev'ry soft emotion burned
within a week , to this sweet charmer came
a rich young squire , who soon declared his flame
AABB
on which she said to nicaise :— he will do
this spark will easily let matters through
and as the belle was confident of that
she gave consent and listened to his chat
AABB
soon all was settled and arranged the day
when marriage they no longer would delay
you 'll fully notice this :— i think i view
the thoughts which move around and you pursue
AABB
i ask but one thing of you , only one
that always you will be my dream of you
that never shall i wake to find untrue
all this i have believed and rested on
ABBA
forever vanished , like a vision gone
out into the night . alas , how few
there are who strike in us a chord we knew
existed , but so seldom heard its tone
ABBA
we tremble at the half forgotten sound
the world is full of rude awakenings
and heaven born castles shattered to the ground
yet still our human longing vainly clings
ABAB
when she comes home again ! a thousand ways
i fashion , to myself , the tenderness
of my glad welcome : i shall tremble — yes
and touch her , as when first in the old days
ABBA
i touched her girlish hand , nor dared upraise
mine eyes , such was my faint heart 's sweet distress
then silence : and the perfume of her dress
the room will sway a little , and a haze
ABBA
cloy eyesight — soul sight , even — for a space
and tears — yes ; and the ache here in the throat
to know that i so ill deserve the place
her arms make for me ; and the sobbing note
ABAB
one do i see and twelve ; but second there
methinks i know thee , thou beloved one
not from thy nobler port , for there are none
more quiet featured : some there are who bear
ABBA
their message on their brows , while others wear
a look of large commission , nor will shun
the fiery trial , so their work is done
but thou hast parted with thine eyes in prayer
ABBA
unearthly are they both ; and so thy lips
seem like the porches of the spirit land
for thou hast laid a mighty treasure by
unlocked by him in nature , and thine eye
AABB
no worke it seem 'd of earthly craftsmans wit
but rather wrought by his owne industry
that thunder dartes for iove his syre doth fit
let me no more see faire thing under sky
ABAB
i dreamed we walked together , you and i
along a white and lonely road , that went
i know not where . . . and we were well content
our laughter was untroubled as the sky
ABBA
and all our talk was delicate and shy
though in that cage of words wild thoughts were pent
like prisoned birds that some sweet accident
might yet release to sing again , and fly
ABBA
we passed between long lines of poplar trees
where , summer comrades gay and debonair
the south wind and the sunlight danced . . . you smiled
with great glad eyes , as bright as summer seas
ABBA
farewell , my best beloved ! whose heavenly mind
genius with virtue , strength with softness join 'd
devotion , undebased by pride or art
with meek simplicity , and joy of heart
AABB
though sprightly , gentle ; though polite , sincere
and only of thyself a judge severe
unblamed , unequall 'd in each sphere of life
the tenderest daughter , sister , parent , wife
AABB
in thee , their patroness the afflicted lost
thy friends their pattern , ornament , and boast
and i — but ah , can words my loss declare
or paint the extremes of transport and despair
AABB
in this prime prelude of the toil that waits
the nascent glories of his infant states
columbus mourn 'd the slain . a numerous crowd
half of each host , had bought their fame with blood
AABB
from the whole hill he saw the lifestream pour
and sloping pathways trod with tracks of gore
here , glorious warren , thy cold earth was seen
here spring thy laurels in immortal green
AABB
dearest of chiefs that ever prest the plain
in freedom 's cause with early honors slain
still dear in death , as when before our sight
you graced the senate , or you led the fight
AABB
‘ come , gentle air ! ’ the aeolian shepherd said
while procris panted in the secret shade
‘ come , gentle air ! ’ the fairer delia cries
while at her feet her swain expiring lies
AABB
lo ! the glad gales o'er all her beauties stray
breathe on her lips , and in her bosom play
in delia 's hand this toy is fatal found
nor could that fabled dart more surely wound
AABB
both gifts destructive to the givers prove
alike both lovers fall by those they love
yet guiltless too this bright destroyer lives
at random wounds , nor knows the wound she gives
AABB
“ what traveller soever wander here
in quest of peace and what is best of pleasure
let not his hope be overcast and drear
because i , death , am here to fix the measure
ABAB
of life , even in blameless arcady
bay , laurel , myrtle , ivy never sere
and fields flower decorated all the year
and streams that carry secrets to the sea
ABBA
the sea is never quiet : east and west
the nations hear it , like the voice of fate
within vast shores its strife makes desolate
still murmuring mid storms that to its breast
ABBA
return , as eagles screaming to their nest
is it the voice of worlds and isles that wait
while old earth crumbles to eternal rest
or some hoar monster calling to his mate
ABAB
after long stormes and tempests sad assay
which hardly i endured heretofore
in dread of death , and daungerous dismay
with which my silly bark was tossed sore
ABAB
i doe at length descry the happy shore
in which i hope ere long for to arryve
fayre soyle it seemes from far , and fraught with store
of all that deare and daynty is alyve
ABAB
o friend ! may each domestic bliss be thine
be no unpleasing melancholy mine
me , let the tender office long engage
to rock the cradle of reposing age
AABB
with lenient arts extend a mother 's breath
make languor smile , and smooth the bed of death
explore the thought , explain the asking eye
and keep a while one parent from the sky
AABB
on cares like these if length of days attend
may heav'n , to bless those days , preserve my friend
preserve him social , cheerful , and serene
and just as rich as when he serv 'd a queen
AABB
why the wild woods for ever must they rove
nor arts nor social joys their passions move
long is the lapse of ages , since thy hand
conducted here thy first adventurous band
AABB
on other shores , in every eastern clime
since that unletter 'd , distant tract of time
what arts have sprung , imperial powers to grace
what sceptres sway 'd the many master 'd race
AABB
thou tyrannizing monarch that dost tire
my love sick heart through those assaulting eyes
that are the lamps which lighten my desire
if nought but death thy fury may suffice
ABAB
this only boon for all my mortal bane
i crave and cry for at thy mercy seat
that when her wrath a faithful heart hath slain
and soul is fled , and body reft of heat
ABAB
love is my sin , and thy dear virtue hate
hate of my sin , grounded on sinful loving
o but with mine , compare thou thine own state
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
ABAB
or if it do , not from those lips of thine
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments
and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine
robbed others ’ beds ’ revenues of their rents
ABAB
be it lawful i love thee as thou lov'st those
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity in thy heart that when it grows
thy pity may deserve to pitied be
ABAB
she hastens out and scarcely pins her clothes
to hear the news and tell the news she knows
she talks of sluts , marks each unmended gown
her self the dirtiest slut in all the town
AABB
she stands with eager haste at slander 's tale
and drinks the news as drunkards drink their ale
excuse is ready at the biggest lie
she only heard it and it passes bye
AABB
the very cat looks up and knows her face
and hastens to the chair to get the place
when once set down she never goes away
till tales are done and talk has nought to say
AABB
what hopes , what terrors , does this gift create
ambiguous emblem of uncertain fate
the myrtle ( ensign of supreme command
consign 'd to venus by melissa 's hand
AABB
not less capricious than a reigning fair
oft favours , oft rejects a lover 's prayer
in myrtle shades oft sings the happy swain
in myrtle shades despairing ghosts complain
AABB
the myrtle crowns the happy lovers ’ heads
the unhappy lovers ’ graves the myrtle spreads
oh ! then , the meaning of thy gift impart
and ease the throbbings of an anxious heart
AABB
the fowler hides as closely as he may
the net , where caught the silly bird should be
lest he the threatening poison should but see
and so for fear be forced to fly away
ABBA
my lady so , the while she doth assay
in curl è d knots fast to entangle me
put on her veil , to th ’ end i should not flee
the golden net wherein i am a prey
ABBA
alas , most sweet ! what need is of a net
to catch a bird that is already ta'en
sith with your hand alone you may it get
for it desires to fly into the same
ABAB
since shunning pain , i ease can never find
since bashful dread seeks where he knows me harmed
since will is won , and stopped ears are charmed
since force doth faint , and sight doth make me blind
ABBA
since loosing long , the faster still i bind
since naked sense can conquer reason armed
since heart , in chilling fear , with ice is warmed
in fine , since strife of thought but mars the mind
ABBA
i yield , o love , unto thy loathed yoke
yet craving law of arms , whose rule doth teach
that , hardly used , who ever prison broke
in justice quit , of honour made no breach
ABAB
thou , nature ! partial nature , i arraign
of thy caprice maternal i complain
the lion and the bull thy care have found
one shakes the forests , and one spurns the ground
AABB
thou giv'st the ass his hide , the snail his shell
th ’ envenom 'd wasp , victorious , guards his cell
thy minions kings defend , control , devour
in all th ’ omnipotence of rule and power
AABB
foxes and statesmen subtile wiles ensure
the cit and polecat stink , and are secure
toads with their poison , doctors with their drug
the priest and hedgehog in their robes , are snug
AABB
milton ! thou should'st be living at this hour
england hath need of thee : she is a fen
of stagnant waters ; altar , sword , and pen
fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower
ABBA
have forfeited their ancient english dower
of inward happiness . we are selfish men
oh ! raise us up , return to us again
and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power
ABBA
thy soul was like a star , and dwelt apart
thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea
pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free
so didst thou travel on life 's common way
ABBA
hard by the road , where on that little mound
the high grass rustles to the passing breeze
the child of misery rests her head in peace
pause there in sadness . that unhallowed ground
ABBA
inshrines what once was isabel . sleep on
sleep on , poor outcast ! lovely was thy cheek
and thy mild eye was eloquent to speak
the soul of pity . pale and woe begone
ABBA
soon did thy fair cheek fade , and thine eye weep
the tear of anguish for the babe unborn
the helpless heir of poverty and scorn
she drank the draught that chill 'd her soul to sleep
ABBA
on such an eve , his palest beam he cast
when — athens ! here thy wisest looked his last
how watched thy better sons his farewell ray
that closed their murdered sage 's
AABB
not yet — not yet — sol pauses on the hill
the precious hour of parting lingers still
but sad his light to agonising eyes
and dark the mountain 's once delightful dyes
AABB
gloom o'er the lovely land he seemed to pour
the land , where phoebus never frowned before
but ere he sunk below cith æ ron 's head
the cup of woe was quaffed — the spirit fled
AABB
mary , since first i knew thee , to this hour
my love hath deepened , with my wiser sense
of what in woman is to reverence
thy clear heart , fresh as e'er was forest flower
ABBA
we can but say we found it in the heart
spring of all sweetest thoughts , arch foe of blame
sower of flowers in the dusty mart
pure vestal of the poet 's holy flame
ABAB
oh ! yet within the tent i see thee lie
the victor , like a coward , crouching by
o'erawed , rebuked , and humbled in the hour
the plenitude of his success and power
AABB
a pain the guilty never make us know
in all the miseries they cause below
a pain which they in every triumph feel
a humbling sense no glory yet could heal
AABB
the want of conscious worth , the poignant thought
that inwardly sets all pretence at naught
that curbs all self applause — tears all disguise
when the subdued , the ruin 'd can despise
AABB
the sea shall praise him and the shores bear part
that reared him when the bright south world was black
with fume of creeds more foul than hell 's own rack
still darkening more love 's face with loveless art
ABBA
since paul , faith 's fervent antichrist , of heart
heroic , haled the world vehemently back
from christ 's pure path on dire jehovah 's track
and said to dark elisha 's lord , ‘ thou art
ABBA
but one whose soul had put the raiment on
of love that jesus left with james and john
withstood that lord whose seals of love were lies
seeing what we see — how , touched by truth 's bright rod
AABB
let not my love be called idolatry
nor my beloved as an idol show
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one , of one , still such , and ever so
ABAB
kind is my love to day , to morrow kind
still constant in a wondrous excellence
therefore my verse to constancy confined
one thing expressing , leaves out difference
ABAB
now in sweet tones the inquiring muse express 'd
her ardent wish ; and thus the fair address 'd
“ priestess of nature ! whose exploring sight
pierces the realms of chaos and of night
AABB
of space unmeasured marks the first and last
of endless time the present , future , past
immortal guide ! o , now with accents kind
give to my ear the progress of the mind
AABB
how loves , and tastes , and sympathies commence
from evanescent notices of sense
how from the yielding touch and rolling eyes
the piles immense of human science rise
AABB
he paused for breath : i falteringly strike in
“ have you a mother ? have you kith or kin
to whom your life is precious ? ” “ not a soul
my line 's extinct : i have interred the whole
AABB
o happy they ! ( so into thought i fell
after life 's endless babble they sleep well
my turn is next : dispatch me : for the weird
has come to pass which i so long have feared
AABB
the fatal weird a sabine beldame sung
all in my nursery days , when life was young
“ no sword nor poison e'er shall take him off
nor gout , nor pleurisy , nor racking cough
AABB
whose gend'ring offspring quickly learn 'd to bow
and yoke their heifers to the roman plough
from whence a mongrel half bred race there came
with neither name nor nation , speech or fame
AABB
in whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran
infused betwixt a saxon and a dane
while their rank daughters , to their parents just
received all nations with promiscuous lust
AABB
‘ whatever spirit , careless of his charge
his post neglects , or leaves the fair at large
shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins
be stopp 'd in vials , or transfix 'd with pins
AABB
or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie
or wedged whole ages in a bodkin 's eye
gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain
while , clogg 'd , he beats his silken wings in vain
AABB
or alum styptics with contracting power
shrink his thin essence like a rivell 'd flower
or , as ixion fix 'd , the wretch shall feel
the giddy motion of the whirling mill
AABB
a lily girl , not made for this world 's pain
with brown , soft hair close braided by her ears
and longing eyes half veiled by slumberous tears
like bluest water seen through mists of rain
ABBA
pale cheeks whereon no love hath left its stain
red underlip drawn in for fear of love
and white throat , whiter than the silvered dove
through whose wan marble creeps one purple vein
ABBA
they say that lonely sorrows do not chance
i think it true , and that the cause i know
a sorrow glideth in a funeral show
easier than if it broke into a dance
ABBA
but i think too , that joy doth joy enhance
as often as an added grief brings low
and if keen eyed to see the flowers that grow
as keen of nerve to feel the thorns that lance
ABBA
the foot that must walk naked in one way
blest by the lily , white from toils and fears
oftener than wounded by the thistle spears
we should walk upright , bold , and earnest gay
ABBA
o messenger , art thou the king , or i
thou dalliest outside the palace gate
till on thine idle armor lie the late
and heavy dews . the morn 's bright scornful eye
ABBA
reminds thee ; then , in subtle mockery
thou smilest at the window where i wait
who bade thee ride for life . in empty state
my days go on , while false hours prophesy
ABBA
thy quick return ; at last , in sad despair
i cease to bid thee , leave thee free as air
when lo , thou stand'st before me glad and fleet
and lay'st undreamedhyppphenof treasures at my feet
AABB
a thousand times to think and think the same
to two fair eyes to show a naked heart
great thirst with bitter liquor to restrain
to take repast of care and crooked smart
ABAB
to sigh full oft without relent of ire
to die for grief and yet conceal the tale
to others ’ will to fashion my desire
to pine in looks disguised through pensive pale
ABAB
a short dispite , a faith unfeign è d true
to love my foe , and set my life at naught
with heedless eyes mine endless harms to view
a will to speak , a fear to tell the thought
ABAB
again columbus turn 'd his anxious eye
where britain 's banner waved along the sky
and , graced with spoils of many fields of blood
cornwallis boastful on a bulwark stood
AABB
where york and gloster 's rocky towers bestride
their parent stream , virginia 's midmost tide
he camp 'd his hundred nations , to regain
their force , exhausted in the long campaign
AABB
paused for a moment on a scene so vast
to plan the future and review the past
thro vanquisht provinces and towns in flame
he mark 'd his recent monuments of fame
AABB
let those who are in favour with their stars
of public honour and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlooked for joy in that i honour most
ABAB
great princes ’ favourites their fair leaves spread
but as the marigold at the sun 's eye
and in themselves their pride lies buried
for at a frown they in their glory die
ABAB
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foiled
is from the book of honour razed quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toiled
ABAB
o queenly month of indolent repose
i drink thy breath in sips of rare perfume
as in thy downy lap of clover bloom
i nestle like a drowsy child and doze
ABBA
the lazy hours away . the zephyr throws
the shifting shuttle of the summer 's loom
and weaves a damask work of gleam and gloom
before thy listless feet . the lily blows
ABBA
a bugle call of fragrance o'er the glade
and wheeling into ranks , with plume and spear
thy harvest armies gather on parade
while faint and far away , yet pure and clear
ABAB
of an athenian young man have i read
who on blind fortune 's picture doated so
that when he could not buy it to his bed
on it he gazing died for very woe
ABAB
my fortune 's picture art thou , flinty dame
that settest golden apples to my sight
but wilt by no means let me taste the same
to drown in sight of land is double spite
ABAB
of fortune as thou learn'dst to be unkind
so learn to be unconstant to disdain
the wittiest women are to sport inclined
honour is pride , and pride is nought but pain
ABAB
behold in awful march and dread array
the long extended squadrons shape their way
death , in approaching terrible , imparts
an anxious horror to the bravest hearts
AABB
yet do their beating breasts demand the strife
and thirst of glory quells the love of life
no vulgar fears can british minds control
heat of revenge and noble pride of soul
AABB
o'er look the foe , advantaged by his post
lessen his numbers , and contract his host
though fens and floods possessed the middle space
that unprovoked they would have feared to pass
AABB
iv . moreover , were there perfect harmony
‘ twixt soul and nature , we should never waste
the precious hours in gazing , but should haste
to assimilate her offerings , and we
ABBA
from high life elements , as doth the tree
should grow to higher ; so what we call taste
is a slow living as of roots encased
in the grim chinks of some sterility
ABBA
both cramping and withholding . art is truth
but truth dammed up and frozen , gagged and bound
as is a streamlet icy and uncouth
which pebbles hath and channel but no sound
ABAB
too long the crucifix on calvary 's height
has cast its shadow on the human heart
let now religion 's great co worker art
limn on the background of departing night
ABBA
the shining face all palpitant with light
and god 's true message to the world impart
go tell each toiler in the home and mart
‘ lo , christ is with ye , if ye seek aright
ABBA
the mountains wonder from their cloudy height
the skies look on and grow more deep with awe
from these two women , earthly loves withdraw
and leave them shrined in some ensphering light
ABBA
more fine than that which greets the earthly sight
more glorious than that creation saw
when , from abeyance to primeval law
there burst the dawn from out the womb of night
ABBA
yet are all things unchanged around them ,— these
the ancient hills , the town , the quiet trees
the household presences through which they grope
blind to all else but to each other 's eyes
AABB
what scenes appear where'er i turn my view
the dear ideas , where i fly , pursue
rise in the grove , before the altar rise
stain all my soul , and wanton in my eyes
AABB
i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee
thy image steals between my god and me
thy voice i seem in every hymn to hear
with every bead i drop too soft a tear
AABB
when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll
and swelling organs lift the rising soul
one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight
priests , tapers , temples , swim before my sight
AABB
with snow white veil and garments as of flame
she stands before thee , who so long ago
filled thy young heart with passion and the woe
from which thy song and all its splendors came
ABBA
and while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name
the ice about thy heart melts as the snow
on mountain height ; and in swift overflow
comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame
ABBA
thou makest full confession ; and a gleam
as of the dawn on some dark forest cast
seems on thy lifted forehead to increase
lethe and eunoe — the remembered dream
ABBA
fraud shrinks from faith : at sight of swans , the raven
chides blackness , and the snake recoils aghast
in fear of poison when a bird flies past
thersites brands achilles as a craven
ABBA
the shoal fed full with shipwreck blames the haven
for murderous lust of lives devoured , and vast
desire of doom whose feast is mercy 's fast
and bacon sees the traitor 's mark engraven
ABBA
full on the front of essex . grief and shame
obscure the chaste and sunlike spirit of oates
at thought of russell 's treason ; and the name
of milton sickens with superb disgust
ABAB
o humble me ! i cannot bide the joy
that in my saviour 's presence ever flows
may i be lowly , lest it may destroy
the peace his childlike spirit ever knows
ABAB
i would not speak thy word , but by thee stand
while thou dost to thine erring children speak
o help me but to keep his own command
and in my strength to feel me ever weak
ABAB
then in thy presence shall i humbly stay
nor lose the life of love he came to give
and find at last the life , the truth , the way
to where with him thy blessed servants live
ABAB
we are ambitious overmuch in life
straining at ends of hard accomplishment
and goaded onward by poor discontent
we build our little babels up through strife
ABBA
and bitterness of soul , and motions rife
with passions that oft slay the innocent
like priests of lust plunging the cruel knife
into the victims of their wilderment
ABAB
not thus do thou , but with a patient hand
place thou thine acorn in the fertile soil
labouring ever with unhurtful toil
and cheerful hope until the seed expand
ABBA
“ will you let any moment dip its wing
into your heart and find no love of me
to tint with deathless dream ” — he said — “ and spring
its flight to the dim bourne of memory
ABAB
will you have any grief that can forget
how grief should find forgetfulness in love
and since your soul in my soul 's zone is set
will it sometimes ask other spheres to rove
ABAB
but then , as now — it may be , something more
woman and man were human to the core
the hearts that throbbed behind that brave attire
burned with a plenitude of essential fire
AABB
they too could risk , they also could rebel
they could love wisely — they could love too well
in that great duel of sex , that ancient strife
which is the very central fact of life
AABB
they could — and did — engage it breath for breath
they could — and did — get wounded unto death
as at all times since time for us began
woman was truly woman , man was man
AABB
with sense of wrong and outrage desperate
strode on and thundered at the palace gate
rushed through the court yard , thrusting in his rage
to right and left each seneschal and page
AABB
and hurried up the broad and sounding stair
his white face ghastly in the torches ’ glare
from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed
voices and cries he heard , but did not heed
AABB
toussaint , the most unhappy man of men
whether the rural milk maid by her cow
sing in thy hearing , or thou liest now
alone in some deep dungeon 's earless den
ABBA
o miserable chieftain ! where and when
wilt thou find patience ? yet die not ; do thou
wear rather in thy bonds a chearful brow
though fallen thyself , never to rise again
ABBA
live , and take comfort . thou hast left behind
powers that will work for thee ; air , earth , and skies
there 's not a breathing of the common wind
that will forget thee ; thou hast great allies
ABAB
“ o truly great ! in whom the gods have join ’ d
such strength of body with such force of mind
in conduct , as in courage , you excel
still first to act what you advise so well
AABB
these wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves
applauding greece with common voice approves
kings thou canst blame ; a bold but prudent youth
and blame even kings with praise , because with truth
AABB
and yet those years that since thy birth have run
would hardly style thee nestor ’ s youngest son
then let me add what yet remains behind
a thought unfinish ’ d in that generous mind
AABB
the knightly legend of thy shield betrays
the moral of thy life ; a forecast wise
and that large honor that deceit defies
inspired thy fathers in the elder days
ABBA
who decked thy scutcheon with that sturdy phrase
to be rather than seem . as eve 's red skies
surpass the morning 's rosy prophecies
thy life to that proud boast its answer pays
ABBA
scorning thy faith and purpose to defend
the ever mutable multitude at last
will hail the power they did not comprehend
thy fame will broaden through the centuries
ABAB
the maple with its tassel flowers of green
that turns to red a staghorn shaped seed
just spreading out its scolloped leaves is seen
of yellowish hue , yet beautifully green
AABB
bark ribbed like corderoy in seamy screed
that farther up the stem is smoother seen
where the white hemlock with white umbel flowers
up each spread stoven to the branches towers
AABB
and moss around the stoven spreads , dark green
and blotched leaved orchis , and the blue bell flowers
thickly they grow and neath the leaves are seen
i love to see them gemmed with morning hours
ABAB
by the dead body of hope , the spotless lamb
thou threwest into the high priest 's slaughtering room
and by the child despair born red therefrom
as , thank the secret sire picked out to cram
ABBA
with spurious spawn thy misconceiving dam
thou , like a worm from a town 's common tomb
didst creep from forth the kennel of her womb
born to break down with catapult and ram
ABBA
man 's builded towers of promise , and with breath
and tongue to track and hunt his hopes to death
o , by that sweet dead body abused and slain
and by that child mismothered ,— dog , by all
AABB
why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way
hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke
ABAB
‘ tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my storm beaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound , and cures not the disgrace
ABAB
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent , yet i have still the loss
th ’ offender 's sorrow lends but weak relief
to him that bears the strong offence 's cross
ABAB
if modest youth , with cool reflection crown 'd
and every opening virtue blooming round
could save a parent 's justest pride from fate
or add one patriot to a sinking state
AABB
yet softer honours , and less noisy fame
attend the shade of gentle buckingham
in whom a race , for courage famed and art
ends in the milder merit of the heart
AABB
‘ conceive me , sirs , nor take my sense amiss
‘ tis what concerns my soul 's eternal bliss
since , if i found no pleasure in my spouse
as flesh is frail , and who ( god help me ) knows
AABB
then should i live in lewd adultery
and sink downright to satan when i die
or were i cursed with an unfruitful bed
the righteous end were lost for which i wed
AABB
to raise up seed to bless the powers above
and not for pleasure only , or for love
think not i dote ; ‘ tis time to take a wife
when vigorous blood forbids a chaster life
AABB
she whose high top above the starres did sore
one foote on thetis , th'other on the morning
one hand on scythia , th'other on the more
both heaven and earth in roundnesse compassing
ABAB
but i have seen pictures the work of man
in which at first appeared but chaos wild
so high the art transcended , they beguiled
the eye as formless , and without a plan
ABBA
so might thy pictures then have been too strange
for us to pierce beyond their outmost look
a vapour and a darkness ; a sealed book
an atmosphere too high for wings to range
ABBA
vain transitory splendours could not all
reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall
obscure it sinks , nor shall it more impart
an hour 's importance to the poor man 's heart
AABB
thither no more the peasant shall repair
to sweet oblivion of his daily care
no more the farmer 's news , the barber 's tale
no more the woodman 's ballad shall prevail
AABB
no more the smith his dusky brow shall clear
relax his ponderous strength , and lean to hear
the host himself no longer shall be found
careful to see the mantling bliss go round
AABB
those parts of thee that the world 's eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
all tongues ( the voice of souls ) give thee that due
uttering bare truth , even so as foes commend
ABAB
thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
ABAB
they look into the beauty of thy mind
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts ( although their eyes were kind
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
ABAB
how long shall this lyke dying lyfe endure
and know no end of her owne mysery
but wast and weare away in termes unsure
‘ twixt feare and hope depending doubtfully
ABAB
but yet if in your hardned brest ye bide
a close intent at last to shew me grace
then all the woes and wrecks which i abide
as meanes of blisse i gladly wil embrace
ABAB
thou stranger , which for rome in rome hero seekest
and nought of rome in rome perceiv'st at all
these same olde walls , olde arches , which thou seest
olde palaces , is that which rome men call
ABAB
thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
these vacant leaves thy mind 's imprint will bear
and of this book , this learning mayst thou taste
ABAB
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
thou by thy dial 's shady stealth mayst know
time 's thievish progress to eternity
ABAB
look what thy memory cannot contain
commit to these waste blanks , and thou shalt find
those children nursed , delivered from thy brain
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
ABAB
when you were born , beloved , was your soul
new made by god to match your body 's flower
and were they both at one same precious hour
sent forth from heaven as a perfect whole
ABBA
or had your soul since dim creation burned
a star in some still region of the sky
that leaping earthward , left its place on high
and to your little new born body yearned
ABBA
no words can tell in what celestial hour
god made your soul and gave it mortal birth
nor in the disarray of all the stars
is any place so sweet that such a flower
ABBA
‘ t is you that are the music , not your song
the song is but a door which , opening wide
lets forth the pent up melody inside
your spirit 's harmony , which clear and strong
ABBA
sings but of you . throughout your whole life long
your songs , your thoughts , your doings , each divide
this perfect beauty ; waves within a tide
or single notes amid a glorious throng
ABBA
the song of earth has many different chords
ocean has many moods and many tones
yet always ocean . in the damp spring woods
the painted trillium smiles , while crisp pine cones
ABAB
they could not take the living god away
although they left his altar blank and bare
their ruthless hands could never rend and tear
more than the walls , they could not hope to sway
ABBA
the utter faith that is the nation 's heart
they could not bring a real destruction where
hymn music had been softly wont to play
they smothered beauty , and tore hope apart
ABBA
but in the house of one who is supreme
the marks they left will now be sanctified
the broken walls , when war is but a dream
will be a monument to those who died
ABAB
all are but parts of one stupendous whole
whose body nature is , and god the soul
that , chang 'd thro ’ all , and yet in all the same
great in the earth , as in th ’ ethereal frame
AABB
warms in the sun , refreshes in the breeze
glows in the stars , and blossoms in the trees
lives thro ’ all life , extends thro ’ all extent
spreads undivided , operates unspent
AABB
breathes in our soul , informs our mortal part
as full , as perfect , in a hair as heart
as full , as perfect , in vile man that mourns
as the rapt seraph that adores and burns
AABB
as every animal assists his kind
just so are these in blood and business joined
yet both in different colours hide their art
and each as suits his ends transacts his part
AABB
but both will chuckle oer their prisoners ’ sighs
and are as blest as spiders over flies
such is bumtagg , whose history i resign
as other knaves wait room to stink and shine
AABB
master of human destinies am i
fame , love , and fortune on my footsteps wait
cities and fields i walk ; i penetrate
deserts and seas remote , and , passing by
ABBA
hovel and mart and palace , soon or late
i knock , unbidden , once at every gate
if sleeping , wake — if feasting , rise — before
i turn away . it is the hour of fate
AABB
and they who follow me reach every state
mortals desire , and conquer every foe
save death ; but those who doubt , or hesitate
condemned to failure , penury , and woe
ABAB
“ all , all are equal : heaven 's impartial mind
one bliss , one woe allots to all mankind
and he whose morn seem 'd wrapp 'd in cloudy night
shall see his evening glow with placid light
AABB
thro ’ calm prosperity 's serenest sky
the approaching gales of adverse fortune sigh
and when affliction whets her keenest dart
and hurls it , flaming , at the shrinking heart
AABB
celestial hope with golden wing attends
heals every wound , and every toil befriends
the horrors vanish ; gleams of light divine
illume the cloud , and thro ’ its openings shine
AABB
the tide is rippling to my very feet
the mountains are before me , and around
stretching in misty grandeur till they meet
in one dim bourne , their hoary summits crown 'd
ABAB
my glass shall not persuade me i am old
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee time 's furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate
ABAB
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live , as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
ABAB
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
as i not for my self , but for thee will
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
ABAB
but to the few construct of harmonies
a sudden sun , uplighting the serene
high heaven of love ; and , through the cloudy screen
that ‘ twixt our souls and truth all wretched lies
ABBA
dawning at length , hadst been a love and fear
worshipped on high from magian 's mountain crest
and all night long symbolled by lamp flames clear
thy sign , a star upon thy people 's breast
ABAB
a tide of beauty with returning may
floods the fair city ; from warm pavements fume
odors endeared ; down avenues in bloom
the chestnut trees with phallic spires are gay
ABBA
over the terrace flows the thronged cafe
the boulevards are streams of hurrying sound
and through the streets , like veins when they abound
the lust for pleasure throbs itself away
ABBA
here let me live , here let me still pursue
phantoms of bliss that beckon and recede
thy strange allurements , city that i love
maze of romance , where i have followed too
ABBA
gehazi by the hue that chills thy cheek
and pilate by the hue that sears thine hand
whence all earth 's waters cannot wash the brand
that signs thy soul a manslayer 's though thou speak
ABBA
all christ , with lips most murderous and most meek
thou set thy foot where england 's used to stand
thou reach thy rod forth over indian land
slave of the slaves that call thee lord , and weak
ABBA
as their foul tongues who praise thee ! son of them
whose presence put the snows and stars to shame
in centuries dead and damned that reek below
curse consecrated , crowned with crime and flame
ABAB
beauty ( they called her ) was n't a maid
of many things in the world afraid
she was n't a maid who turned and fled
at sight of a mouse , alive or dead
AABB
she was n't a maid a man could “ shoo
by shouting , however abruptly , “ boo
she was n't a maid who 'd run and hide
if her face and figure you idly eyed
AABB
she was'nt a maid who 'd blush and shake
when asked what part of the fowl she 'd take
( i blush myself to confess she preferred
and commonly got , the most of the bird
AABB
if glorious visions , born for all mankind
the bright auroras of our twilight mind
if fancies , varying as the shapes that lie
stained on the windows of the sunset sky
AABB
if hopes , that beckon with delusive gleams
till the eye dances in the void of dreams
if passions , following with the winds that urge
earth 's wildest wanderer to her farthest verge
AABB
if these on all some transient hours bestow
of rapture tingling with its hectic glow
then all are poets ; and if earth had rolled
her myriad centuries , and her doom were told
AABB
such as the berecynthian goddesse bright
in her swifte charret with high turrets crownde
proud that so manie gods she brought to light
such was this citie in her good daies fownd
ABAB
this citie , more than that great phrygian mother
renowm 'd for fruite of famous progenie
whose greatnes by the greatnes of none other
but by her selfe , her equall match could see
ABAB
rome onely might to rome compared bee
and onely rome could make great rome to tremble
so did the gods by heavenly doome decree
that other earthlie power should not resemble
ABAB
the sun , his journey ending in the west
taketh his lodging up in thetis ’ bed
though from our eyes his beams be banish è d
yet with his light th ’ antipodes be blest
ABBA
then i , o sun of suns ! and light of lights
wish me with those antipodes to be
which see and feel thy beams and heat by nights
well , though the night both cold and darksome is
ABAB
thespis began the drama : rumour says
in travelling carts he carried round his plays
where actors , smeared with lees , before the throng
performed their parts with gesture and with song
AABB
then aeschylus brought in the mask and pall
put buskins on his men to make them tall
turned boards into a platform , not too great
and taught high monologue and grand debate
AABB
the elder comedy had next its turn
nor small the glory it contrived to earn
but freedom passed into unbridled spite
and law was soon invoked to set things right
AABB
i cannot tell what change hath come to you
to vex your splendid hair . i only know
one grief . the passion left betwixt us two
like some forsaken watchfire , burneth low
ABAB
‘ tis sad to turn and find it dying so
without a hope of resurrection ! yet
o radiant face that found me tired and lone
i shall not for the dear , dead past forget
ABAB
lift up the curtain carefully . all the trees
stand in the dark like drowsy sentinels
the oak is talkative to night ; he tells
the little bushes crowding at his knees
ABBA
that formidable , hard , voluminous
history of growth from acorn into age
they titter like school children ; they arouse
their comrades , who exclaim : ‘ he is very sage
ABAB
look how the moon is staring through that cloud
laying and lifting idle streaks of light
o hark ! was that the monstrous wind , so loud
and sudden , prowling always through the night
ABAB
for , rich with spoils of many a conquered land
all arts and artists theseus could command
who sold for hire , or wrought for better fame
the master painters and the carvers came
AABB
so rose within the compass of the year
an age 's work , a glorious theatre
then o'er its eastern gate was raised above
a temple , sacred to the queen of love
AABB
the passing traveller with wonder sees
a deep and ancient stonepit full of trees
so deep and very deep the place has been
the church might stand within and not be seen
AABB
the passing stranger oft with wonder stops
and thinks he een could walk upon their tops
and often stoops to see the busy crow
and stands above and sees the eggs below
AABB
and while the wild horse gives its head a toss
the squirrel dances up and runs across
the boy that stands and kills the black nosed bee
dares down as soon as magpies ’ nests are found
AABB
to check the invader 's horror spreading course
the barrier fort opposed unequal force
that fort whose walls , extending wide , contained
the stay of persia , men to battle trained
AABB
what chieftain dares our war like realms invade
“ and who art thou ? ” sohr á b indignant said
rushing towards him with undaunted look
“ hast thou , audacious ! nerve and soul to brook
AABB
‘ o hapless youth !— for she thy love hath won
the tender zara will be most undone
big swell 'd my heart , and own 'd the powerful maid
when fast she dropt her tears , as thus she said
AABB
“ farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain
whom zara 's breaking heart implored in vain
yet , as thou go'st , may every blast arise
weak and unfelt , as these rejected sighs
AABB
safe o'er the wild , no perils mayst thou see
no griefs endure , nor weep , false youth , like me
o let me safely to the fair return
say , with a kiss , she must not , shall not mourn
AABB
run , shepherds , run where bethlehem blest appears
we bring the best of news ; be not dismayed
a saviour there is born more old than years
amidst heaven 's rolling heights this earth who stayed
ABAB
in a poor cottage inned , a virgin maid
a weakling did him bear , who all upbears
there is he poorly swaddled , in manger laid
to whom too narrow swaddlings are our spheres
ABAB
run , shepherds , run , and solemnize his birth
this is that night — no , day , grown great with bliss
in which the power of satan broken is
in heaven be glory , peace unto the earth
ABBA
it is my dream to have you here with me
out of the heated city 's dust and din
here where the colts have room to gambol in
and kine to graze , in clover to the knee
ABBA
i want to see your wan face happily
lit with the wholesome smiles that have not been
in use since the old games you used to win
when we pitched horseshoes : and i want to be
ABBA
impelled by feelings in their nature kind
but slightly weak and somewhat undefined
rush at each other , make a sudden stand
begin to talk , expatiate , and expand
AABB
each looks quite radiant , seems extremely struck
their meeting so was such a piece of luck
each thinks the other thinks he ‘ s greatly pleased
to screw the vice in which they both are squeezed
AABB
so there they talk , in dust , or mud , or snow
both bored to death , and both afraid to go
your hat once lifted , do not hang your fire
nor , like slow ajax , fighting still , retire
AABB
their course had hardly run three other days
when fair aminta , studious still of ways
to have her wish , again to alice came
to give dear cleon notice of her flame
AABB
my home , cried she , ‘ tis requisite i leave
to ruin me , your cousin , i perceive
is still resolved , for presents now he sends
but he mistakes , and blindly wealth expends
AABB
i 'm clearly not the woman he suspects
see here , what jewels rare to please the sex
nice rubies , diamonds too , but what is more
my portrait i have found among the store
AABB
a dimness of a glory glimmers here
thro ’ veils and distance from the space remote
a faintest far vibration of a note
reaches to us and seems to bring us near
ABBA
causing our face to glow with braver cheer
making the serried mist to stand afloat
subduing languor with an antidote
and strengthening love almost to cast out fear
ABBA
till for one moment golden city walls
rise looming on us , golden walls of home
light of our eyes until the darkness falls
then thro ’ the outer darkness burdensome
ABAB
the stars come out ; the fragrant shadows fall
about a dreaming garden still and sweet
i hear the unseen bats above me bleat
among the ghostly moths their hunting call
ABBA
and twinkling glow worms all about me crawl
now for a chamber dim , a pillow meet
for slumbers deep as death , a faultless sheet
cool , white and smooth . so may i reach the hall
ABBA
with poppies strewn where sleep that is so dear
with magic sponge can wipe away an hour
or twelve and make them naught . why not a year
why could a man not loiter in that bower
ABAB
upon my word , replied another fair
if he were mine , i openly declare
to judge from what so pleasantly you say
i 'd make a present of him new year 's day
AABB
for pleasure never gives me full delight
unless a little pain the bliss invite
no doubt your husband moves as he is led
thank heav'n a different mortal claims my bed
AABB
to take him in , great nicety we need
but howsoe'er , at times i can succeed
the satisfaction doubly then is felt
in fond emotion bosoms freely melt
AABB
he plays with other boys when work is done
but feels too clumsy and too stiff to run
yet where there 's mischief he can find a way
the first to join and last [ to run ] away
AABB
what 's said or done he never hears or minds
but gets his pence for all the eggs he finds
he thinks his master 's horses far the best
and always labours longer than the rest
AABB
in frost and cold though lame he 's forced to go
the call 's more urgent when he journeys slow
in surly speed he helps the maids by force
and feeds the cows and hallos till he 's hoarse
AABB
when old jack died , it seemed a human friend
had suddenly gone from us ; that some face
that we had loved to fondle and embrace
from babyhood , no more would condescend
ABBA
to smile on us forever . we might bend
with tearful eyes above him , interlace
our chubby fingers o'er him , romp and race
plead with him , call and coax — aye , we might send
ABBA
in april 's gilded morn when south winds blow
and gently shake the hawthorn 's silver crown
wafting its scent the forest glade adown
the dewy shelter of the bounding doe
ABBA
then , under trees , soft tufts of primrose show
their palely yellowing flowers ;— to the moist sun
blue harebells peep , while cowslips stand unblown
plighted to riper may ;— and lavish flow
ABBA
the lark 's loud carols in the wilds of air
o ! not to nature 's glad enthusiast cling
avarice , and pride .— thro ’ her now blooming sphere
charm 'd as he roves , his thoughts enraptur 'd spring
ABAB
above my head , an indolent , trusting thing
when all this silly dream is finished here
the fellows will go home to where there fall
rose petals over every street , and all
AABB
the year is like a friendly festival
but i shall never watch those hedges drip
color , not see the tall spar of a ship
in our old harbor . — they say that i am dying
ABBA
so am i as the rich whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
ABAB
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
to make some special instant special blest
by new unfolding his imprisoned pride
ABAB
ye , who by the couches of languishing ones
have watched through the rising and setting of suns
who , silent , behind the close curtain , withdrawn
scarce know that the current of being sweeps on
AABB
to whom outer life is unreal , untrue
a world with whose moils ye have nothing to do
who feel that the day , with its multiform rounds
is full of discordant , impertinent sounds
AABB
who speak in low whispers , and stealthily tread
as if a faint footfall were something to dread
who find all existence ,— its gladness , its gloom
enclosed by the walls of that limited room
AABB
i was no coward . country bred and born
i had no feeling but the keenest scorn
for those fine lady “ ah 's ” and “ oh 's ” of fear
so much assumed ( when any man is near
AABB
‘ tis said , for forty days the spectre stayed
for forty days the knight incessant prayed
with scourge , with vigil and ascetic rite
with fast , with groan remorseful and contrite
AABB
he cleansed his blackened spirit by degrees
and purified it from its vanities
and as he prayed , the spectre 's gruesome scowl
grew day by day less hideous and foul
AABB
as he waxed holy , it became more bright
and after forty days , arrayed in white
it spread its spotless arms , devoid of taint
above this erstwhile knight and henceforth saint
AABB
long has the pall of midnight quench 'd the scene
and wrapt the hush 'd horizon .— all around
in scatter 'd huts , labor , in sleep profound
lies stretch 'd , and rosy innocence serene
ABBA
slumbers ;— but creeps , with pale and starting mien
benighted superstition .— fancy found
the late self slaughter 'd man , in earth yet green
and festering , burst from his incumbent mound
ABAB
the world is too much with us ; late and soon
getting and spending , we lay waste our powers
little we see in nature that is ours
we have given our hearts away , a sordid boon
ABBA
this sea that bares her bosom to the moon
the winds that will be howling at all hours
and are up gathered now like sleeping flowers
for this , for everything , we are out of tune
ABBA
it moves us not .— great god ! i 'd rather be
a pagan suckled in a creed outworn
so might i , standing on this pleasant lea
have glimpses that would make me less forlorn
ABAB
meanwhile , convened at priam ’ s palace gate
the trojan peers in nightly council sate
a senate void of order , as of choice
their hearts were fearful , and confused their voice
AABB
antenor , rising , thus demands their ear
“ ye trojans , dardans , and auxiliars , hear
’ tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires
and i but move what every god requires
AABB
let sparta ’ s treasures be this hour restored
and argive helen own her ancient lord
the ties of faith , the sworn alliance , broke
our impious battles the just gods provoke
AABB
so is it with this singing art of ours
that once with maids went maidenlike , and played
with woven dances in the poplar shade
and all her song was but of lady 's bowers
ABBA
and the returning swallows , and spring flowers
till forth to seek a shadow queen she strayed
a shadowy land ; and now hath overweighed
her singing chaplet with the snow and showers
ABBA
the wind was soft before the sunset fled
now , while the cloud enshrouded corpse of day
is lowered along a red funereal way
down to the dark that knows not white from red
ABBA
a clear sheer breeze against the night makes head
serene , but sure of life as ere a ray
springs , or the dusk of dawn knows red from grey
being as a soul that knows not quick from dead
ABBA
from far beyond the sunset , far above
full toward the starry soundless east it blows
bright as a child 's breath breathing on a rose
smooth to the sense as plume of any dove
ABBA
weary was love and sought to take his rest
he made his choice , upon a virgin 's lap
and slyly crept from thence unto her breast
where still he meant to sport him in his hap
ABAB
the virgin frowned like phoebus in a cloud
“ go pack , sir boy , here is no room for such
my breast no wanton foolish boy must shroud
this said , my love did give the wag a touch
ABAB
then as the foot that treads the stinging snake
hastes to be gone , for fear what may ensue
so love my love was forced for to forsake
and for more speed , without his arrows flew
ABAB
seek us and find us , for we cannot thee
or seek or find or hold or cleave unto
we cannot do or undo ; lord , undo
our self undoing , for thine is the key
ABBA
“ the land of cyclops first , a savage kind
nor tamed by manners , nor by laws confined
untaught to plant , to turn the glebe , and sow
they all their products to free nature owe
AABB
the soil , untill 'd , a ready harvest yields
with wheat and barley wave the golden fields
spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour
and jove descends in each prolific shower
AABB
by these no statues and no rights are known
no council held , no monarch fills the throne
but high on hills , or airy cliffs , they dwell
or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell
AABB
sometimes in verse i praised , sometimes in verse sighed
no more shall pen with love and beauty mell
but to my heart alone my heart shall tell
how unseen flames do burn it day and night
ABBA
lest flames give light , light bring my love to sight
and my love prove my folly to excel
wherefore my love burns like the fire of hell
wherein is fire and yet there is no light
ABBA
for if one never loved like me , then why
skill less blames he the thing he doth not know
and he that so hath loved should favour show
for he hath been a fool as well as i
ABBA
the chief of lara is returned again
and why had lara crossed the bounding main
left by his sire , too young such loss to know
lord of himself ,— that heritage of woe
AABB
that fearful empire which the human breast
but holds to rob the heart within of rest
with none to check , and few to point in time
the thousand paths that slope the way to crime
AABB
then , when he most required commandment , then
had lara 's daring boyhood governed men . [ jc
it skills not , boots not step by step to trace
his youth through all the mazes of its race
AABB
without delay they to the convent flew
but when the holy mansion came in view
respect , the place of execution changed
a citizen his barn for this arranged
AABB
the crafty crew together were confined
and in the blaze their wretched lives resigned
while round the husbands danced at sound of drum
and burnt whatever to their hands had come
AABB
naught ‘ scaped their fury , monks of all degrees
robes , mantles , capuchins , and mock decrees
all perished properly within the flames
but nothing more i find about the dames
AABB
th ’ ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight
eager of action , and demand the fight
then king tolumnius , vers 'd in augurs ’ arts
cries out , and thus his boasted skill imparts
AABB
“ at length ‘ t is granted , what i long desir 'd
this , this is what my frequent vows requir 'd
ye gods , i take your omen , and obey
advance , my friends , and charge ! i lead the way
AABB
these are the foreign foes , whose impious band
like that rapacious bird , infest our land
but soon , like him , they shall be forc 'd to sea
by strength united , and forego the prey
AABB
thinking of you , and all that was , and all
that might have been and now can never be
i feel your honored excellence , and see
myself unworthy of the happier call
ABBA
for woe is me who walk so apt to fall
so apt to shrink afraid , so apt to flee
apt to lie down and die ( ah , woe is me
faithless and hopeless turning to the wall
ABBA
and yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite
because not loveless ; love may toil all night
but take at morning ; wrestle till the break
of day , but then wield power with god and man
AABB
quirinus , bacchus , and the jove born pair
though now invoked with in cense , gifts , and prayer
while yet on earth they civilized their kind
tilled lands , built cities , properties assigned
AABB
oft mourned for man 's ingratitude , and found
the race they served less thankful than the ground
the prince whose fated vassalage subdued
fell hydra 's power and all the monster brood
AABB
soon found that envy , worse than all beside
could only be extinguished when he died
he that outshines his age is like a torch
which , when it blazes high , is apt to scorch
AABB
ah me ! and i am now the man whose muse
in happier times was wont to laugh at love
and those who suffer 'd that blind boy abuse
the noble gifts were given them from above
ABAB
he said ; and high before the tiger train
with longer strides hangs forward o'er the slain
bends like a falling tree to reach the foe
and o'er tall capac aims a forceful blow
AABB
the king beheld the ax , and with his wand
struck the raised weapon from the sachem 's hand
then clench 'd the falling helve , and whirling round
fell 'd a close file of heroes to the ground
AABB
nor stay 'd , but follow 'd where his people run
fearing to fight , forsaken by the sun
till cusco 's walls salute their longing sight
and the wide gates receive their rapid flight
AABB
i call no goddess to inspire my strains
a fabled muse may suit a bard that feigns
friend of my life ! my ardent spirit burns
and all the tribute of my heart returns
AABB
for boons accorded , goodness ever new
the gifts still dearer , as the giver you
thou orb of day ! thou other paler light
and all ye many sparkling stars of night
AABB
if aught that giver from my mind efface
if i that giver 's bounty e'er disgrace
then roll to me along your wand'rig spheres
only to number out a villain 's years
AABB
lord of my love , to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty , not to show my wit
ABAB
duty so great , which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare , in wanting words to show it
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy soul 's thought ( all naked ) will bestow it
ABAB
festivals have i seen that were not names
this is young buonaparte 's natal day
and his is henceforth an established sway
consul for life . with worship france proclaims
ABBA
her approbation , and with pomps and games
heaven grant that other cities may be gay
calais is not : and i have bent my way
to the sea coast , noting that each man frames
ABBA
his business as he likes . another time
that was , when i was here long years ago
the senselessness of joy was then sublime
happy is he , who , caring not for pope
ABAB
and in the morning , when the tempest drops
at every cottage door mountainous heaps
of snow lie drifted , that all entrance stops
untill the beesom and the shovel gain
ABAB
the path , and leave a wall on either side
the shepherd rambling valleys white and wide
with new sensations his old memory fills
when hedges left at night , no more descried
AABB
bride of the shark , her valour first i sing
who on the lone seas quickened of a king
she , from the shore and puny homes of men
beyond the climber 's sea discerning ken
AABB
swam , led by omens ; and devoid of fear
beheld her monstrous paramour draw near
she gazed ; all round her to the heavenly pale
the simple sea was void of isle or sail
AABB
sole overhead the unsparing sun was reared
when the deep bubbled and the brute appeared
but she , secure in the decrees of fate
made strong her bosom and received the mate
AABB
time flies , hope flags , life plies a wearied wing
death following hard on life gains ground apace
faith runs with each and rears an eager face
outruns the rest , makes light of everything
ABBA
spurns earth , and still finds breath to pray and sing
while love ahead of all uplifts his praise
still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace
content with all day brings and night will bring
ABBA
life wanes ; and when love folds his wings above
tired hope , and less we feel his conscious pulse
let us go fall asleep , dear friend , in peace
a little while , and age and sorrow cease
AABB
like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
ABAB
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity , wherewith being crowned
crooked eclipses ‘ gainst his glory fight
and time that gave , doth now his gift confound
ABAB
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beauty 's brow
feeds on the rarities of nature 's truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
ABAB
on the green bank i sat , and listen 'd long
( sitting was more convenient for the song
nor till her lay was ended could i move
but wish 'd to dwell for ever in the grove
AABB
and what alone did all the rest surpass
the sweet possession of the fairy place
single , and conscious to myself alone
of pleasures to the excluded world unknown
AABB
remember me when i am gone away
gone far away into the silent land
when you can no more hold me by the hand
nor i half turn to go yet turning stay
ABBA
remember me when no more day by day
you tell me of our future that you planned
only remember me ; you understand
it will be late to counsel then or pray
ABBA
yet if you should forget me for a while
and afterwards remember , do not grieve
for if the darkness and corruption leave
a vestige of the thoughts that once i had
ABBA
all in the trossachs ’ glen was still
noontide was sleeping on the hill
sudden his guide whooped loud and high
“ murdoch ! was that a signal cry
AABB
he stammered forth — “ i shout to scare
yon raven from his dainty fare
he looked — he knew the raven 's prey
his own brave steed — “ ah ! gallant gray
AABB
for thee — for me , perchance — ‘ twere well
we ne'er had seen the trossachs ’ dell
murdoch , move first — but silently
whistle or whoop , and thou shalt die
AABB
but we who know thee , proudly point the hand
where thy broad rivers roll serenely grand
where , in still beauty ‘ neath our northern sky
thy lordly lakes in solemn grandeur lie
AABB
where old niagara 's awful voice has given
the flood 's deep anthem to the ear of heaven
through the long ages of the vanished past
through summer 's bloom , and winter 's angry blast
AABB
nature 's proud utterance of unwearied song
now , as at first , majestic , solemn , strong
and ne'er to fail , till the archangel 's cry
shall still the million tones of earth and sky
AABB
what though , for showing truth to flatter 'd state
kind hunt was shut in prison , yet has he
in his immortal spirit , been as free
as the sky searching lark , and as elate
ABBA
minion of grandeur ! think you he did wait
think you he nought but prison walls did see
till , so unwilling , thou unturn'dst the key
ah , no ! far happier , nobler was his fate
ABBA
in spenser 's halls he strayed , and bowers fair
culling enchanted flowers ; and he flew
with daring milton through the fields of air
to regions of his own his genius true
ABAB
she turns her head and in a flash of laughter
looks up at him : and helplessly he feels
that life has circled with returning wheels
back to a starting point . before and after
ABBA
merge in this instant , momently the same
for it was thus she leaned and laughing turned
when , manifest , the spirit of beauty burned
in her young body with an inward flame
ABBA
mute was the mighty organ . none might break
the silence that had thralled it since was stilled
the master hand beneath whose touch it thrilled
to music such as choiring seraphs make
ABBA
until a mightier master came to wake
th ’ elusive chords and subtle harmonies
that lay imprisoned in the cold white keys
and once again the soul of music spake
ABBA
methought my soul 's most perfect melodies
no hand again to sonance could evoke
a silent harp whose potence none might prove
but , lo ! one came who swept its chords and woke
ABAB
o child of mine , my little son , alas
beneath the sunlight of thy gentle eyes
too soon , too soon , what fateful shadows rise
like night foretold in some sweet woodland glass
ABBA
on tender feet that scarcely bow the grass
what stains are those of ripe pomegranate dyes
when on my breast thy head in slumber lies
what thorns are those that through my heart do pass
ABBA
and round about these crowds of haunting forms
that burn their splendor through my dimmest dreams
o little child , thou wonder too divine
thy precious body all my bosom warms
ABBA
if this be love , to war against my soul
lie down to wail , rise up to sigh and grieve
the never resting stone of care to roll
still to complain my griefs , whilst none relieve
ABAB
if this be love , to clothe me with dark thoughts
haunting untrodden paths to wail apart
my pleasures horror , music tragic notes
tears in mine eyes and sorrow at my heart
ABAB
i dare not move my dim eyes any way
despair behind , and death before , doth cast
such terror , and my feeble flesh doth waste
by sin in it , which it towards hell doth weigh
ABBA
only thou art above , and when towards thee
by thy leave i can look , i rise again
but our old subtle foe so tempteth me
that not one hour myself i can sustain
ABAB
x . cease then , nor order imperfection name
our proper bliss depends on what we blame
know thy own point : this kind , this due degree
of blindness , weakness , heaven bestows on thee
AABB
submit — in this , or any other sphere
secure to be as bless 'd as thou canst bear
safe in the hand of one disposing power
or in the natal , or the mortal hour
AABB
all nature is but art , unknown to thee
all chance , direction , which thou canst not see
all discord , harmony not understood
all partial evil , universal good
AABB
with how sad steps , o moon ! thou climb'st the skies
how silently , and with how wan a face
what ! may it be , that even in heavenly place
that busy archer his sharp arrows tries
ABBA
sure , if that long with love acquainted eyes
can judge of love , thou feel'st a lover 's case
i read it in thy looks ; thy languish 'd grace
to me that feel the like , thy state descries
ABBA
then , even of fellowship , o moon , tell me
is constant love deem 'd there but want of wit
are beauties there as proud as here they be
do they above love to be loved , and yet
ABAB
queen regnant she , and so shall be for aye
as long as her still unpolluted sea
shall wash the borders of her brave and free
and mother her incomparable bay
ABBA
the pharisees and falsehood mongers may
be rashly blatant as they care to be
she yet with dauntless , old time liberty
will hold her own indomitable way
ABBA
a royal one , all love and heart can bear
the all of strength that human arm can wield
are thine devotedly , and ever thine
and thou wilt use them till thy brow shall wear
ABBA
if there be nothing new , but that which is
hath been before , how are our brains beguiled
which labouring for invention bear amis
the second burthen of a former child
ABAB
o that record could with a backward look
even of five hundred courses of the sun
show me your image in some antique book
since mind at first in character was done
ABAB
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended , or whether better they
or whether revolution be the same
ABAB
and openly who is your freend or foo
and over al this , if any lady bright
hath set hir herte on any maner wight
if he be fals , she shal his treson see
ABBA
then that dread angel near the awful throne
leaving the seraphs ranged in flaming tiers
winged his dark way through those unpinioned spheres
and on the void 's black beetling edge , alone
ABBA
stood with raised wings , and listened for the tone
of god 's command to reach his eager ears
while chaos wavered , for she felt her years
unsceptered now in that convulsive zone
ABBA
night trembled . and as one hath oft beheld
a lamp within a vase light up its gloom
so god 's voice lighted him , from heel to plume
“ let there be light ! ” it said , and darkness , quelled
ABBA
‘ my dearest lord ! farewell , ’ said he , ‘ farewell
heaven bless the king ; may no misfortune tell
the injustice of his hate when i am dead
they 're coming now ; perhaps my guiltless head
AABB
here , in your sight , must then a bleeding lie
and scarce your own stand safe for being nigh
think me not scared with death , howe'er ‘ t appear
i know thou canst not think so : it is a fear
AABB
from which thy love and dammin speaks me free
i 've met him face to face , and ne'er could see
one terror in his looks to make me fly
when virtue bids me stand ; but i would die
AABB
when your perfections to my thoughts appear
they say among themselves , “ o happy we
whichever shall so rare an object see
but happy heart , if thoughts less happy were
ABBA
for their delights have cost my heart full dear
in whom of love a thousand causes be
and each cause breeds a thousand loves in me
and each love more than thousand hearts can bear
ABBA
how can my heart so many loves then hold
which yet by heaps increase from day to day
but like a ship that 's o'ercharged with gold
must either sink or hurl the gold away
ABAB
o pope ! instructor of my studious days
who fix 'd my steps in virtue 's early ways
on whom our labours , and our hopes depend
thou more than patron , and ev'n more than friend
AABB
above all flattery , all thirst of gain
and mortal but in sickness , and in pain
thou taught'st old satire nobler fruits to bear
and check 'd her licence with a moral care
AABB
thou gav'st the thought new beauties not its own
and touch 'd the verse with graces yet unknown
each lawless branch thy level eye survey 'd
and still corrected nature as she stray 'd
AABB
when , looking on the present face of things
i see one man , of men the meanest too
rais 'd up to sway the world , to do , undo
with mighty nations for his underlings
ABBA
the great events with which old story rings
seem vain and hollow ; i find nothing great
nothing is left which i can venerate
so that almost a doubt within me springs
ABBA
of providence , such emptiness at length
seems at the heart of all things . but , great god
i measure back the steps which i have trod
and tremble , seeing , as i do , the strength
ABBA
“ still may our souls , o generous youth ! agree
’ tis now atrides ’ turn to yield to thee
rash heat perhaps a moment might control
not break , the settled temper of thy soul
AABB
not but ( my friend ) ’ tis still the wiser way
to waive contention with superior sway
for ah ! how few , who should like thee offend
like thee , have talents to regain the friend
AABB
to plead indulgence , and thy fault atone
suffice thy father ’ s merit and thy own
generous alike , for me , the sire and son
have greatly suffer ’ d , and have greatly done
AABB
but love whilst that thou mayst be loved again
now whilst thy may hath filled thy lap with flowers
now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain
now use thy summer smiles , ere winter lowers
ABAB
and whilst thou spread'st unto the rising sun
the fairest flower that ever saw the light
now joy thy time before thy sweet be done
and , delia , think thy morning must have night
ABAB
and that thy brightness sets at length to west
when thou wilt close up that which now thou showest
and think the same becomes thy fading best
which then shall most inveil and shadow most
ABAB
ah , woe is me for pleasure that is vain
ah , woe is me for glory that is past
pleasure that bringeth sorrow at the last
glory that at the last bringeth no gain
ABBA
so saith the sinking heart ; and so again
it shall say till the mighty angel blast
is blown , making the sun and moon aghast
and showering down the stars like sudden rain
ABBA
a rose , as fair as ever saw the north
grew in a little garden all alone
a sweeter flower did nature ne'er put forth
nor fairer garden yet was never known
ABAB
the maidens danc 'd about it morn and noon
and learned bards of it their ditties made
the nimble fairies by the pale faced moon
water 'd the root and kiss 'd her pretty shade
ABAB
but well a day , the gard'ner careless grew
the maids and fairies both were kept away
and in a drought the caterpillars threw
themselves upon the bud and every spray
ABAB
this mighty empire hath but feet of clay
of all its ancient chivalry and might
our little island is forsaken quite
some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay
ABBA
and from its hills that voice hath passed away
which spake of freedom : o come out of it
come out of it , my soul , thou art not fit
for this vile traffic house , where day by day
ABBA
wisdom and reverence are sold at mart
and the rude people rage with ignorant cries
against an heritage of centuries
it mars my calm : wherefore in dreams of art
ABBA
mountains ! and huge hills ! wrap your mighty forms
close with mantle of eternal cloud
gather around ye the fierce band of storms
and let the stainless snow drift be your shroud
ABAB
back from your rugged steeps , and caverns hoar
bellow in hoarse disdain the tempest 's roar
laugh at the rolling thunder ; let the flash
of its fierce lightning lumine but your scorn
AABB
shades of those belles whose reign began of yore
with george the third 's — and ended long before
though in your daughters ’ daughters yet you thrive
burst from your lead , and be yourselves alive
AABB
back to the ball room speed your spectred host
fools ’ paradise is dull to that you lost
no treacherous powder bids conjecture quake
no stiff starch 'd stays make meddling fingers ache
AABB
( transferr 'd to those ambiguous things that ape
goats in their visage , women in their shape
no damsel faints when rather closely press 'd
but more caressing seems when most caress 'd
AABB
not long i had observed , when from afar
i heard a sudden symphony of war
the neighing coursers , and the soldiers cry
and sounding trumps , that seem 'd to tear the sky
AABB
i saw soon after this , behind the grove
from whence the ladies did in order move
come issuing out in arms a warrior train
that like a deluge pour 'd upon the plain
AABB
on barbed steeds they rode in proud array
thick as the college of the bees in may
when swarming o'er the dusky fields they fly
new to the flowers , and intercept the sky
AABB
death in a rage assaulted once my heart
with love of her , my love that doth deny
i scorned his force , and wished him to depart
i heartless was , and therefore could not die
ABAB
i live in her , in her i placed my life
she guides my soul , and her i honour must
nor is this life but yet a living strife
a thing unmeet , and yet a thing most just
ABAB
cupid enraged did fly to make me love
my heart lay guarded with those burning eyes
the sparks whereof denied him to remove
so conquered now , he like a captive lies
ABAB
nay , lord , not thus ! white lilies in the spring
sad olive groves , or silver breasted dove
teach me more clearly of thy life and love
than terrors of red flame and thundering
ABBA
the hillside vines dear memories of thee bring
a bird at evening flying to its nest
tells me of one who had no place of rest
i think it is of thee the sparrows sing
ABBA
come rather on some autumn afternoon
when red and brown are burnished on the leaves
and the fields echo to the gleaner 's song
come when the splendid fulness of the moon
ABBA
the lady has agreed , you will remark
that in a room where ev'ry part is dark
( perhaps to ‘ scape the keeper 's prying sight
or shame directs exclusion of the light
AABB
she will receive your gay inconstant spouse
now , take her place ; the case deceit allows
make jack your friend ; nor haggle at the price
a hundred ducats give , is my advice
AABB
he 'll place you in the room where darkness reigns
think not too fast , nor suffer heavy chains
do what you wish , and utter not a word
to speak , assuredly would be absurd
AABB
far be the guilt of homeshed blood from all
on whom , unsought , embroiling dangers fall
still the pale dead revives , and lives to me
to me ! through pity 's eye condemned to see
AABB
remembrance veils his rage , but swells his fate
grieved i forgive , and am grown cool too late
young , and unthoughtful then ; who knows , one day
what ripening virtues might have made their way
AABB
he might have lived till folly died in shame
till kindling wisdom felt a thirst for fame
he might perhaps his country 's friend have proved
both happy , generous , candid , and beloved
AABB
but pallas now tydides ’ soul inspires
fills with her force , and warms with all her fires
above the greeks his deathless fame to raise
and crown her hero with distinguish ’ d praise
AABB
high on his helm celestial lightnings play
his beamy shield emits a living ray
the unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies
like the red star that fires the autumnal skies
AABB
when fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight
and , bathed in ocean , shoots a keener light
such glories pallas on the chief bestow ’ d
such , from his arms , the fierce effulgence flow ’ d
AABB
here now is winter . winter , after all
is not so drear as was my boding dream
while autumn gleamed its latest watery gleam
on sapless leafage too inert to fall
ABBA
still leaves and berries clothe my garden wall
where ivy thrives on scantiest sunny beam
still here a bud and there a blossom seem
hopeful , and robin still is musical
ABBA
leaves , flowers and fruit and one delightful song
remain ; these days are short , but now the nights
intense and long , hang out their utmost lights
such starry nights are long , yet not too long
ABBA
as due by many titles , i resign
myself to thee , o god ! first i was made
by thee , and for thee ; and when i was decayed
thy blood bought that , the which before was thine
ABBA
i am thy son , made with thyself to shine
thy servant , whose pains thou hast still repaid
thy sheep , thine image ; and , till i betrayed
myself , a temple of thy spirit divine
ABBA
why doth the devil then usurp on me
why doth he steal , nay , ravish , that 's thy right
except thou rise , and for thine own work fight
oh ! i shall soon despair , when i shall see
ABBA
‘ here let us walk , ’ he said , ‘ observed by none
conscious of pleasures to the world unknown
so may my soul have joy , as thou , my wife
art far the dearest solace of my life
AABB
and rather would i choose , by heaven above
to die this instant , than to lose thy love
reflect what truth was in my passion shown
when , unendow 'd , i took thee for my own
AABB
and sought no treasure but thy heart alone
old as i am , and now deprived of sight
whilst thou art faithful to thy own true knight
nor age , nor blindness rob me of delight
AABB
the panther , knowing that his spotted hyde
doth please all beasts , but that his looks them fray
within a bush his dreadful head doth hide
to let them gaze , whylst he on them may pray
ABAB
right so my cruell fayre with me doth play
for with the goodly semblance of her hew
she doth allure me to mine owne decay
and then no mercy will unto me shew
ABAB
dear ladies , though last to receive my oblation
and last in the list of mosaic creation
the last is the best , and the last shall be first
through eve , sayeth moses , old adam was cursed
AABB
but i cannot agree with you , moses , that adam
sinned and fell through the gentle persuasion of madam
the victim , no doubt , of egyptian flirtation
you mistook your chagrin for divine inspiration
AABB
and condemned all the sex without proof or probation
as we rhymsters mistake the moonbeams that elate us
for flashes of wit or the holy afflatus
and imagine we hear the applause of a nation
ABBA
fresh spring , the herald of loves mighty king
in whose cote armour richly are displayd
all sorts of flowres the which on earth do spring
in goodly colours gloriously arrayd
ABAB
goe to my love , where she is carelesse layd
yet in her winters bowre not well awake
tell her the ioyous time wil not be staid
unlesse she doe him by the forelock take
ABAB
bid her therefore her selfe soone ready make
to wayt on love amongst his lovely crew
where every one that misseth then her make
shall be by him amearst with penance dew
ABAB
the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts
and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts
at this , the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook
a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look
AABB
she sees , and trembles at th ’ approaching ill
just in the jaws of ruin , and codille
and now ( as oft in some distemper 'd state
on one nice trick depends the gen'ral fate
AABB
an ace of hearts steps forth : the king unseen
lurk 'd in her hand , and mourn 'd his captive queen
he springs to vengeance with an eager pace
and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace
AABB
toward the sea turning my troubled eye
i saw the fish ( if fish i may it cleepe
that makes the sea before his face to flye
and with his flaggie finnes doth seeme to sweepe
ABAB
the fomie waves out of the dreadfull deep
the huge leviathan , dame natures wonder
making his sport , that manie makes to weep
a sword fish small him from the rest did sunder
ABAB
that , in his throat him pricking softly under
his wide abysse him forced forth to spewe
that all the sea did roare like heavens thunder
and all the waves were stain 'd with filthie hewe
ABAB
receive thine own ; for i and it are thine
thou know'st its story ; how for forty days
weary with sickness and with social haze
( after thy hands and lips with love divine
ABBA
had somewhat soothed me , made the glory shine
though with a watery lustre ,) more delays
of blessedness forbid — i took my ways
into a solitude , invention 's mine
ABBA
there thought and wrote , afar , and yet with thee
those days gone past , i came , and brought a book
my child , developed since in limb and look
it came in shining vapours from the sea
ABBA
when beauty to the world vouchsafes this bliss
to show the one whose other there is not
the whitest skins red blushing shame doth blot
and in the reddest cheeks pale envy is
ABBA
the poor in beauty thus content remain
to see their jealous cause revenged in thee
and their fair foes afflicted with like pain
lo , the clear proof of thy divinity
ABAB
the lady of the leaf ordain 'd a feast
and made the lady of the flower her guest
when , lo ! a bower ascended on the plain
with sudden seats ordain 'd , and large for either train
AABB
this bower was near my pleasant arbour placed
that i could hear and see whatever pass 'd
the ladies sat with each a knight between
distinguish 'd by their colours , white and green
AABB
the vanquish 'd party with the victors join 'd
nor wanted sweet discourse , the banquet of the mind
meantime the minstrels play 'd on either side
vain of their art , and for the mastery vied
AABB
if in this storm of joy and pompous throng
this nymph ( great king ) doth come to thee so near
that thy harmonious ears her accents hear
give pardon to her hoarse and lowly song
ABBA
fain would she trophies to thy virtues rear
but for this stately task she is not strong
and her defects her high attempts do wrong
yet as she could she makes thy worth appear
ABBA
so in a map is shown this flowery place
so wrought in arras by a virgin 's hand
with heaven and blazing stars doth atlas stand
so drawn by charcoal is narcissus ’ face
ABBA
ye heralds of my heart , mine ardent groans
o tears which gladly would burst out to brooks
oh spent on fruitless sand my surging moans
oh thoughts enthralled unto care boding looks
ABAB
ah just laments of my unjust distress
ah fond desires whom reason could not guide
oh hopes of love that intimate redress
yet prove the load stars unto bad betide
ABAB
when will you cease ? or shall pain never ceasing
seize oh my heart ? oh mollify your rage
lest your assaults with over swift increasing
procure my death , or call on timeless age
ABAB
there is a race of men , who master life
their victory being inversely as their strife
who capture by refraining from pursuit
shake not the bough , yet load their hands with fruit
AABB
the earth 's high places who attain to fill
by most indomitably sitting still
while others , full upon the fortress hurled
lay fiery siege to the embattled world
AABB
of such rude arts their natures feel no need
greatly inert , they lazily succeed
find in the golden mean their proper bliss
and doing nothing , never do amiss
AABB
with strength of righteous purpose in the heart
what cause to fear for consequence of deed
god guideth then , not we ; nor do we need
to care for aught but that we play our part
ABBA
most simple trust is often highest art
the issue we would fly may be a seed
ordained by god to bear our souls a meed
of peace that no self judging could impart
ABBA
this then at last ; we may be wiser far
than love , and put his folly to our measure
yet shall we learn , poor wizards that we are
that love chimes not nor motions at our pleasure
ABAB
we bid him come , and light an eager fire
and he goes down the road without debating
we cast him from the house of our desire
and when at last we leave he will be waiting
ABAB
and in the end there is no folly but this
to counsel love out of our little learning
for still he knows where rotten timber is
and where the boughs for the long winter burning
ABAB
thou shouldst have risen as never dawn yet rose
day of the sunrise of the soul of france
dawn of the whole world 's morning , when the trance
of all the world had end , and all its woes
ABBA
respite , prophetic of their perfect close
light of all tribes of men , all names and clans
dawn of the whole world 's morning and of man 's
flower of the heart of morning 's mystic rose
ABBA
dawn of the very dawn of very day
when the sun brighter breaks night 's ruinous prison
thou shouldst have risen as yet no dawn has risen
evoked of him whose word puts night away
ABBA
in the greek land of old there was a king
happy in battle , rich in everything
most rich in this , that he a daughter had
whose beauty made the longing city glad
AABB
she was so fair , that strangers from the sea
just landed , in the temples thought that she
was venus visible to mortal eyes
new come from cyprus for a world 's surprise
AABB
she was so beautiful that had she stood
on windy ida by the oaken wood
and bared her limbs to that bold shepherd 's gaze
troy might have stood till now with happy days
AABB
to whom the king : “ in such distress we stand
no vulgar counsel our affairs demand
greece to preserve , is now no easy part
but asks high wisdom , deep design , and art
AABB
for jove , averse , our humble prayer denies
and bows his head to hector ’ s sacrifice
what eye has witness ’ d , or what ear believed
in one great day , by one great arm achieved
AABB
such wondrous deeds as hector ’ s hand has done
and we beheld , the last revolving sun
what honours the beloved of jove adorn
sprung from no god , and of no goddess born
AABB
there is a bondage which is worse to bear
than his who breathes , by roof , and floor , and wall
pent in , a tyrant 's solitary thrall
‘ tis his who walks about in the open air
ABBA
one of a nation who , henceforth , must wear
their fetters in their souls . for who could be
who , even the best , in such condition , free
from self reproach , reproach which he must share
ABBA
with human nature ? never be it ours
to see the sun how brightly it will shine
and know that noble feelings , manly powers
instead of gathering strength must droop and pine
ABAB
the virtuous delegates behold with pain
the hostile britons hovering o'er the main
lament the strife that bids two worlds engage
and blot their annals with fraternal rage
AABB
two worlds in one broad state ! whose bounds bestride
like heaven 's blue arch , the vast atlantic tide
by language , laws and liberty combined
great nurse of thought , example to mankind
AABB
columbia rears her warning voice in vain
brothers to brothers call across the main
britannia 's patriots lend a listening ear
but kings and courtiers push their mad career
AABB
for had she not been fair and thus unkind
then had no finger pointed at my lightness
the world had never known what i do find
and clouds obscure had shaded still her brightness
ABAB
then had no censor 's eye these lines surveyed
nor graver brows have judged my muse so vain
no sun my blush and error had bewrayed
nor yet the world had heard of such disdain
ABAB
then had i walked with bold erected face
no downcast look had signified my miss
but my degraded hopes with such disgrace
did force me groan out griefs and utter this
ABAB
with lilies woven and with wet woodbine
till once they sought the bright aetnaean flowers
and their bright mistress fled from summer hours
with hades , down the irremeable decline
ABBA
and they have sought her all the wide world through
till many years , and wisdom , and much wrong
have filled and changed their song , and o'er the blue
rings deadly sweet the magic of the song
ABAB
the fairest flowers that decked the earth
into a nosegay , with wise choice combined
thus the first art from nature had its birth
into a garland then were nosegays twined
ABAB
and from the works that mortal hands had made
a second , nobler art was now displayed
the child of beauty , self sufficient now
that issued from your hands to perfect day
AABB
sweet cytherea , sitting by a brook
with young adonis , lovely , fresh , and green
did court the lad with many a lovely look
such looks as none could look but beauty 's queen
ABAB
a dream there is wherein we are fain to scream
while struggling with ourselves we cannot speak
and much of all our waking life , as weak
and misconceived , eludes us like the dream
ABBA
for half life 's seemings are not what they seem
and vain the laughs we laugh , the shrieks we shriek
yea , all is vain that mars the settled meek
contented quiet of our daily theme
ABBA
when i was young i deemed that sweets are sweet
but now i deem some searching bitters are
sweeter than sweets , and more refreshing far
and to be relished more , and more desired
ABBA
i stood beside his sepulchre whose fame
hurled over europe once on bolt and blast
now glows far off as storm clouds overpast
glow in the sunset flushed with glorious flame
ABBA
has nature marred his mould ? can art acclaim
no hero now , no man with whom men side
as with their hearts ’ high needs personified
there are will say , one such our lips could name
ABBA
columbia gave him birth . him genius most
gifted to rule . against the world 's great man
lift their low calumny and sneering cries
the pharisaic multitude , the host
ABBA
was this his coming ! i had hoped to see
a scene of wondrous glory , as was told
of some great god who in a rain of gold
broke open bars and fell on danae
ABBA
or a dread vision as when semele
sickening for love and unappeased desire
prayed to see god 's clear body , and the fire
caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly
ABBA
with such glad dreams i sought this holy place
and now with wondering eyes and heart i stand
before this supreme mystery of love
some kneeling girl with passionless pale face
ABBA
to whom the cloud compeller , answ'ring , thus
“ the purpose , neptune , well thou know'st thyself
for which i call 'd ye ; true , they needs must die
but still they claim my care ; yet here will i
AABB
hear what the desolate rizpah said
as on gibeah 's rocks she watched the dead
the sons of michal before her lay
and her own fair children , dearer than they
AABB
by a death of shame they all had died
and were stretched on the bare rock , side by side
and rizpah , once the loveliest of all
that bloomed and smiled in the court of saul
AABB
all wasted with watching and famine now
and scorched by the sun her haggard brow
sat mournfully guarding their corpses there
and murmured a strange and solemn air
AABB
hath he not deeds to do and days to see
yet ere the day that is to see him dead
beats there no brain yet in the poisonous head
throbs there no treason ? if no such thing there be
ABBA
if no such thought , surely this is not he
look to the hands then ; are the hands not red
what are the shadows about this man 's bed
death , was not this the cupbearer to thee
ABBA
nay , let him live then , till in this life 's stead
even he shall pray for that thou hast to give
till seeing his hopes and not his memories fled
even he shall cry upon thee a bitter cry
ABAB
dunbar , no poet wears your laurels now
none rises , singing , from your race like you
dark melodist , immortal , though the dew
fell early on the bays upon your brow
ABBA
and tinged with pathos every halcyon vow
and brave endeavor . silence o'er you threw
flowerets of love . or , if an envious few
of your own people brought no garlands , how
ABBA
could malice smite him whom the gods had crowned
if , like the meadow lark , your flight was low
your flooded lyrics half the hilltops drowned
a wide world heard you , and it loved you so
ABAB
over the threshold of his pleasant home
set in green clearings passed the exiled friend
in simple trust , misdoubting not the end
“ dear heart of mine ! ” he said , “ the time has come
ABBA
to trust the lord for shelter . ” one long gaze
the goodwife turned on each familiar thing
the lowing kine , the orchard blossoming
the open door that showed the hearth fire 's blaze
ABBA
and calmly answered , “ yes , he will provide
silent and slow they crossed the homestead 's bound
lingering the longest by their child 's grave mound
“ move on , or stay and hang ! ” the sheriff cried
ABBA
outside the dusk , but in the little room
all is alive with light , which brightly glints
on curving cup or the stiff folds of chintz
evoking its own whiteness . shadows loom
ABBA
bulging and black , upon the walls , where hang
rich coloured plates of beauties that appeal
less to the sense of sight than to the feel
so moistly satin are their breasts . a pang
ABBA
almost of pain , runs through him when he sees
hanging , a homeless marvel , next to these
the silken breastplate of a mandarin
centuries dead , which he had given her
AABB
man , earth 's poor shadow ! talks of earth 's decay
but hath it nothing of eternal kin
no majesty that shall not pass away
no soul of greatness springing up within
ABAB
thought marks without hoar shadows of sublime
pictures of power , which if not doomed to win
eternity , stand laughing at old time
for ages : in the grand ancestral line
ABAB
of things eternal , mounting to divine
i read magnificence where ages pay
worship like conquered foes to the apennine
because they could not conquer . there sits day
ABAB
friend , whom thy fourscore winters leave more dear
than when life 's roseate summer on thy cheek
burned in the flush of manhood 's manliest year
lonely , how lonely ! is the snowy peak
ABAB
thy feet have reached , and mine have climbed so near
close on thy footsteps ‘ mid the landscape drear
i stretch my hand thine answering grasp to seek
warm with the love no rippling rhymes can speak
AABB
look backward ! from thy lofty height survey
thy years of toil , of peaceful victories won
of dreams made real , largest hopes outrun
look forward ! brighter than earth 's morning ray
ABBA
whether he lurked in the oldtown fen
or the gray earth flax of the devil 's den
or swam in the wooded artichoke
or coiled by the northman 's written rock
AABB
nothing on record is left to show
only the fact that he lived , we know
and left the cast of a double head
in the scaly mask which he yearly shed
AABB
for he earned a head where his tail should be
and the two , of course , could never agree
but wriggled about with main and might
now to the left and now to the right
AABB
‘ first may the yawning earth her bosom rend
and let me hence to hell alive descend
or die the death i dread no less than hell
sew 'd in a sack , and plunged into a well
AABB
ere i my fame by one lewd act disgrace
or once renounce the honour of my race
for know , sir knight , of gentle blood i came
i loathe a whore , and startle at the name
AABB
but jealous men on their own crimes reflect
and learn from thence their ladies to suspect
else why these heedless cautions , sir , to me
these doubts and fears of female constancy
AABB
whether he lurked in the oldtown fen
or the gray earth flax of the devil 's den
or swam in the wooded artichoke
or coiled by the northman 's written rock
AABB
nothing on record is left to show
only the fact that be lived , we know
and left the cast of a double head
in the scaly mask which he yearly shed
AABB
for he carried a head where his tail should be
and the two , of course , could never agree
but wriggled about with main and might
now to the left and now to the right
AABB
the days pass by , empty of thought and will
his thought grows stagnant at its very springs
with every channel on the world of things
dammed up , and thus , by its long standing still
ABBA
poisons itself and sickens to decay
all his high love for her , his fair desire
loses its light ; and a dull rancorous fire
burning darkness and bitterness that prey
ABBA
upon his heart are left . his spirit burns
sometimes with hatred , or the hatred turns
to a fierce lust for her , more cruel than hate
till he is weary wrestling with its force
AABB
being my self captyved here in care
my hart , ( whom none with servile bands can tye
but the fayre tresses of your golden hayre
breaking his prison , forth to you doth fly
ABAB
like as a byrd , that in ones hand doth spy
desired food , to it doth make his flight
even so my hart , that wont on your fayre eye
to feed his fill , flyes backe unto your sight
ABAB
doe you him take , and in your bosome bright
gently encage , that he may be your thrall
perhaps he there may learne , with rare delight
to sing your name and prayses over all
ABAB
old joe is gone , who saw hot percy goad
his slow artillery up the concord road
a tale which grew in wonder year by year
as every time he told it , joe drew near
AABB
to the main fight , till faded and grown gray
the original scene to bolder tints gave way
then joe had heard the foe 's scared double quick
beat on stove drum with one uncaptured stick
AABB
and , ere death came the lengthening tale to lop
himself had fired , and seen a red coat drop
had joe lived long enough , that scrambling fight
had squared more nearly to his sense of right
AABB
fair star of evening , splendour of the west
star of my country !— on the horizon 's brink
thou hangest , stooping , as might seem , to sink
on england 's bosom ; yet well pleased to rest
ABBA
meanwhile , and be to her a glorious crest
conspicuous to the nations . thou , i think
should'st be my country 's emblem ; and should'st wink
bright star ! with laughter on her banners , drest
ABBA
in thy fresh beauty . there ! that dusky spot
beneath thee , that is england ; there she lies
blessings be on you both ! one hope , one lot
one life , one glory !— i , with many a fear
ABAB
“ we went , ulysses ! ( such was thy command
through the lone thicket and the desert land
a palace in a woody vale we found
brown with dark forests , and with shades around
AABB
a voice celestial echoed through the dome
or nymph or goddess , chanting to the loom
access we sought , nor was access denied
radiant she came : the portals open 'd wide
AABB
the goddess mild invites the guests to stay
they blindly follow where she leads the way
i only wait behind of all the train
i waited long , and eyed the doors in vain
AABB
dark and more dark the shades of evening fell
the wished for point was reached — but at an hour
when little could be gained from that rich dower
of prospect , whereof many thousands tell
ABBA
yet did the glowing west with marvellous power
salute us ; there stood indian citadel
temple of greece , and minster with its tower
substantially expressed — a place for bell
ABAB
or clock to toll from ! many a tempting isle
with groves that never were imagined , lay
‘ mid seas how steadfast ! objects all for the eye
of silent rapture , but we felt the while
ABBA
before the mountains were brought forth , before
earth and the world were made , then god was god
and god will still be god , when flames shall roar
round earth and heaven dissolving at his nod
ABAB
for though he slay us we will trust in him
we will flock home to him by divers ways
yea , though he slay us we will vaunt his praise
serving and loving with the cherubim
ABBA
said he , we now are in a place retired
unknown to man , ( such spots how oft desired
let 's take advantage of the present hour
no joys , but those of love , are in our pow'r
AABB
all others see withdrawn ! and no one knows
we even live ; perhaps both friends and foes
believe us in the belly of a whale
allow me , lovely princess , to prevail
AABB
bestow your kindness , or , without delay
those charms to mamolin let me convey
yet , why go thither ?— happy you could make
the man , whose constancy no perils shake
AABB
the prince return 'd : “ renown 'd in days of yore
has stood our father 's hospitable door
no other roof a stranger should receive
no other hands than ours the welcome give
AABB
but in my absence riot fills the place
nor bears the modest queen a stranger 's face
from noiseful revel far remote she flies
but rarely seen , or seen with weeping eyes
AABB
no — let eurymachus receive my guest
of nature courteous , and by far the best
he woos the queen with more respectful flame
and emulates her former husband 's fame
AABB
how many bards gild the lapses of time
a few of them have ever been the food
of my delighted fancy ,— i could brood
over their beauties , earthly , or sublime
ABBA
and often , when i sit me down to rhyme
these will in throngs before my mind intrude
but no confusion , no disturbance rude
do they occasion ; ‘ tis a pleasing chime
ABBA
so the unnumber 'd sounds that evening store
the songs of birds — the whisp'ring of the leaves
the voice of waters — the great bell that heaves
with solemn sound ,— and thousand others more
ABBA
already , if my mem'ry do not fail
i 've said , the youth 's estates were put to sale
to pay for feasts the fair to entertain
and what he 'd left was only one domain
AABB
a petty farm to which he now retired
ashamed to show where once so much admired
and wretched too , a prey to lorn despair
unable to obtain by splendid care
AABB
a beauty he 'd pursued six years and more
and should for ever fervently adore
his want of merit was the cause he thought
that she could never to his wish be brought
AABB
meantime the banish 'd polynices roves
( his thebes abandon 'd ) through the aonian groves
while future realms his wandering thoughts delight
his daily vision , and his dream by night
AABB
forbidden thebes appears before his eye
from whence he sees his absent brother fly
with transport views the airy rule his own
and swells on an imaginary throne
AABB
fain would he cast a tedious age away
and live out all in one triumphant day
he chides the lazy progress of the sun
and bids the year with swifter motion run
AABB
now surely is the hour come for farewell
now , with the lessened light and darkened days
who now would tread the wild hill 's pathless ways
we found so fair when spring and summer 's spell
ABBA
made blind our hearts this parting to foretell
yet why , while wan and wintry sunlight stays
on perished gold of autumn fields , delays
your heart to speak , while both our hearts rebel
ABBA
together we have gathered through the year
all that the year could give us of its best
is it not meet our parting should be here
now in the season drear of death and rest
ABAB
if music and sweet poetry agree
as they must needs , the sister and the brother
then must the love be great ‘ twixt thee and me
because thou lovest the one , and i the other
ABAB
dowland to thee is dear , whose heavenly touch
upon the lute doth ravish human sense
spenser to me , whose deep conceit is such
as , passing all conceit , needs no defence
ABAB
their course had hardly run three other days
when fair aminta , studious still of ways
to have her wish , again to alice came
to give dear cleon notice of her flame
AABB
my home , cried she , ‘ tis requisite i leave
to ruin me , your cousin , i perceive
is still resolved , for presents now he sends
but he mistakes , and blindly wealth expends
AABB
i 'm clearly not the woman he suspects
see here , what jewels rare to please the sex
nice rubies , diamonds too , but what is more
my portrait i have found among the store
AABB
i am afraid , oh i am so afraid
the cold black fear is clutching me to night
as long ago when they would take the light
and leave the little child who would have prayed
ABBA
frozen and sleepless at the thought of death
my heart that beats too fast will rest too soon
i shall not know if it be night or noon
yet shall i struggle in the dark for breath
ABBA
will no one fight the terror for my sake
the heavy darkness that no dawn will break
how can they leave me in that dark alone
who loved the joy of light and warmth so much
AABB
thro solid curls of smoke , the bursting fires
climb in tall pyramids above the spires
concentring all the winds ; whose forces , driven
with equal rage from every point of heaven
AABB
whirl into conflict , round the scantling pour
the twisting flames and thro the rafters roar
suck up the cinders , send them sailing far
to warn the nations of the raging war
AABB
bend high the blazing vortex , swell 'd and curl 'd
careering , brightening o'er the lustred world
absorb the reddening clouds that round them run
lick the pale stars , and mock their absent sun
AABB
as constant as the moon , she plays her part
and like a viper preys upon his heart
draws him so poor , till like her slaves
which she bestows on some smart fop she loves
AABB
for this is with ‘ em a perpetual rule
they never love the person that they fool
this he perceives not till it is too late
till ruined in his person and estate
AABB
she said , and for her lost galanthis sighs
when the fair consort of her son replies
‘ since you a servant 's ravish 'd form bemoan
and kindly sigh for sorrows not your own
AABB
let me ( if tears and grief permit ) relate
a nearer woe , a sister 's stranger fate
no nymph of all oechalia could compare
for beauteous form with dryope the fair
AABB
her tender mother 's only hope and pride
( myself the offspring of a second bride
this nymph , compress 'd by him who rules the day
whom delphi and the delian isle obey
AABB
holy of holies , my bare feet draw nigh
jesus , thy body is the shining veil
by which i look on god , nor grow death pale
i know that in my verses poor may lie
ABBA
things low , for see , the thinker is not high
but were my song as loud as saints ’ all hail
as pure as prophet 's cry of warning wail
as holy as thy mother 's ecstasy
ABBA
he sings a better , who , for love or ruth
into his heart a little child doth take
nor thoughts nor feelings , art nor wisdom seal
the man who at thy table bread shall break
ABAB
always we are following a light
always the light recedes ; with groping hands
we stretch toward this glory , while the lands
we journey through are hidden from our sight
ABBA
dim and mysterious , folded deep in night
we care not , all our utmost need demands
is but the light , the light ! so still it stands
surely our own if we exert our might
ABBA
fool ! never can'st thou grasp this fleeting gleam
its glowing flame would die if it were caught
its value is that it doth always seem
but just a little farther on . distraught
ABAB
but what avail inadequate words to reach
the innermost of truth ? who shall essay
blinded and weak , to point and lead the way
or solve the mystery in familiar speech
ABBA
yet , if it be that something not thy own
some shadow of the thought to which our schemes
creeds , cult , and ritual are at best but dreams
is even to thy unworthiness made known
ABBA
thou mayst not hide what yet thou shouldst not dare
to utter lightly , lest on lips of thine
the real seem false , the beauty undivine
so , weighing duty in the scale of prayer
ABBA
“ as ever on this side the boiling wave
thou seest diminishing , ” the centaur said
“ so on the other , be thou well assur 'd
it lower still and lower sinks its bed
ABAB
captain , or colonel , or knight in arms
whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize
if deed of honour did thee ever please
guard them , and him within protect from harms
ABBA
he can requite thee ; for he knows the charms
that call fame on such gentle acts as these
and he can spread thy name o'er land and seas
whatever clime the sun 's bright circle warms
ABBA
lift not thy spear against the muses ’ bower
the great emanthian conqueror bid spare
the house of pindarus , when temple and tower
went to the ground ; and the repeated air
ABAB
unnumber 'd ailes connect unnumber 'd halls
and sacred symbols crowd the pictur 'd walls
with pencil rude forgotten days design
and arts , or empires , live in every line
AABB
while chain 'd reluctant on the marble ground
indignant time reclines , by sculpture bound
and sternly bending o'er a scroll unroll 'd
inscribes the future with his style of gold
AABB
— so erst , when proteus on the briny shore
new forms assum 'd of eagle , pard , or boar
the wise atrides bound in sea weed thongs
the changeful god amid his scaly throngs
AABB
the squire had wished his trusty man , no doubt
had not , at cudgelling , been quite so stout
but since he showed himself so true a friend
and with his actions could such prudence blend
AABB
the master fully pardoned what he knew
and quickly to his wife in bed he flew
when he related every thing that passed
were we , cried he , a hundred years to last
AABB
my lovely dear , we ne'er on earth could find
a man so faithful , and so well inclined
i 'd have him take within our town a wife
and you and i 'll regard him during life
AABB
the lad disguised was terrified to death
each plan was dissipated with a breath
the more he thought of means from thence to get
the greater were the obstacles he met
AABB
at length necessity ( the parent found
of stratagems and wiles , so much renowned
induced the youth . . . ( i scarcely can proceed
to tie . . . expression here i clearly need
AABB
what word will decently express the thought
what book has got it ?— where should it be sought
you 've heard , in days of yore that human kind
with windows in their bosoms were designed
AABB
round cleon 's brow the delphic laurels twine
and lo ! the laurel decks amanda 's breast
charm 'd shall he mark its glossy branches shine
on that contrasting snow ; shall see express 'd

love 's better omens , in the green hues dress 'd
of this selected foliage .— nymph , ‘ t is thine

his swift pursuit , till on thessalian shore
shot into boughs , and rooted to the soil
ABAB
england ! the time is come when thou should'st wean
thy heart from its emasculating food
the truth should now be better understood
old things have been unsettled ; we have seen
ABBA
england ! all nations in this charge agree
but worse , more ignorant in love and hate
far — far more abject , is thine enemy
therefore the wise pray for thee , though the freight
ABAB
can i forget the dismal night that gave
my soul 's best part forever to the grave
how silent did his old companions tread
by midnight lamps , the mansions of the dead
AABB
through breathing statues , then unheeded things
through rows of warriors , and through walks of kings
what awe did the slow solemn knell inspire
the pealing organ , and the pausing choir
AABB
the duties by the lawn robed prelate paid
and the last words , that dust to dust conveyed
while speechless o'er thy closing grave we bend
accept these tears , thou dear departed friend
AABB
fayre eyes ! the myrrour of my mazed hart
what wondrous vertue is contayn 'd in you
the which both lyfe and death forth from you dart
into the obiect of your mighty view
ABAB
for when ye mildly looke with lovely hew
then is my soule with life and love inspired
but when ye lowre , or looke on me askew
then do i die , as one with lightning fyred
ABAB
but since that lyfe is more then death desyred
looke ever lovely , as becomes you best
that your bright beams , of my weak eies admyred
may kindle living fire within my brest
ABAB
dares he behold the thing he is , what thing
he would become is in his mind its child
astir , demanding birth to light and wing
for battle prompt , by pleasure unbeguiled
ABAB
so moves he forth in faith , if he has made
his mind god 's temple , dedicate to truth
earth 's nourishing delights , no more gainsaid
he tastes , as doth the bridegroom rich in youth
ABAB
then knows he love , that beckons and controls
the star of sky upon his footway cast
then match in him who holds his tempters fast
the body 's love and mind 's , whereof the soul 's
ABBA
as heir expectant of unnumbered spoons
he wakes a patriot ; presto , he is clad
as fallstaff for the battle — raving mad
lo ! baltimore becomes the first emprise
ABBA
when gilmor 's scandal shock 'd the men at guy 's
“ to horse , to horse , ” our hero drunk exclaims
“ i 'll crush rebellion — give the town to flames
the faithful groom the pawing steed attends
ABBA
the maudlin cyclops all oblique ascends
but ere the lambent flames consume the town
the cid unhorsed , like bacchus , topples down
old juno 's goose erst saved imperial rome
ABBA
but more than this what moves me most of all
to leave not all unworded and unsped
the whole heart 's greeting of my thanks unsaid
scarce needs this sign , that from my tongue should fall
ABBA
his name whom sorrow and reverent love recall
the sign to friends on earth of that dear head
alive , which now long since untimely dead
the wan grey waters covered for a pall
ABBA
their trustless reaches dense with tangling stems
took never life more taintless of rebuke
more pure and perfect , more serene and kind
than when those clear eyes closed beneath the thames
ABBA
i see thine image through my tears to night
and yet to day i saw thee smiling . how
refer the cause ?— beloved , is it thou
or i , who makes me sad ? the acolyte
ABBA
amid the chanted joy and thankful rite
may so fall flat , with pale insensate brow
on the altar stair . i hear thy voice and vow
perplexed , uncertain , since thou art out of sight
ABBA
as he , in his swooning ears , the choir 's amen
beloved , dost thou love ? or did i see all
the glory as i dreamed , and fainted when
too vehement light dilated my ideal
ABAB
see , now me thinkes , the cloudes in throngs
the lightning leaps too , at my ravishing songs
iris about my neck hangs round
and with her divers colour ’ d bow , i ’ me bound
AABB
remembring horace , thee , my guide
when my high genius through th ’ ayre doth ride
now o ’ re the scatt ’ red islands , then
o ’ re seas , with dry feet passing back again
AABB
her quivering fins and panting gills she hides
but spreads her silver arms upon the tides
205 slow as she sails , her ivory neck she laves
and shakes her golden tresses o'er the waves
AABB
charm 'd round the nymph , in circling gambols glide
four nereid forms , or shoot along the tide
now all as one they rise with frolic spring
210 and beat the wondering air on humid wing
AABB
now all descending plunge beneath the main
and lash the foam with undulating train
above , below , they wheel , retreat , advance
in air and ocean weave the mazy dance
AABB
beloved , in the noisy city here
the thought of thee can make all turmoil cease
around my spirit , folds thy spirit clear
its still , soft arms , and circles it with peace
ABAB
there is no room for any doubt or fear
in souls so overfilled with love 's increase
there is no memory of the bygone year
but growth in heart 's and spirit 's perfect ease
ABAB
how hath our love , half nebulous at first
rounded itself into a full orbed sun
how have our lives and wills ( as haply erst
they were , ere this forgetfulness begun
ABAB
good kosciusko , thy great name alone
is a full harvest whence to reap high feeling
it comes upon us like the glorious pealing
of the wide spheres — an everlasting tone
ABBA
and now it tells me , that in worlds unknown
the names of heroes , burst from clouds concealing
and changed to harmonies , for ever stealing
through cloudless blue , and round each silver throne
ABBA
it tells me too , that on a happy day
when some good spirit walks upon the earth
thy name with alfred 's , and the great of yore
gently commingling , gives tremendous birth
ABAB
not with libations , but with shouts and laughter
we drenched the altars of love 's sacred grove
shaking to earth green fruits , impatient after
the launching of the colored moths of love
ABAB
love 's proper myrtle and his mother 's zone
we bound about our irreligious brows
and fettered him with garlands of our own
and spread a banquet in his frugal house
ABAB
not yet the god has spoken ; but i fear
though we should break our bodies in his flame
and pour our blood upon his altar , here
henceforward is a grove without a name
ABAB
did you but know the virtuous steps she trod
while thus devoted to the little god
you 'd thank a hundred times the pow'rs above
that gave you such a child to bless your love
AABB
but many other customs there abound
the fair with perfect liberty are found
can go and come , whene'er the humour fits
no eunuch ( shadow like ) that never quits
AABB
but watches ev'ry movement :— always feared
no men , but who 've upon the chin a beard
your daughter from the first , their manners took
so easy is her ev'ry act and look
AABB
day after day i dreamed there , while my heart
gathered up knowledge in its childish way
making fine pictures with unconscious art
and learning beauty more and more each day
ABAB
far up above me grew the long armed beech
dropping its branches down in graceful bent
while farther up , beyond my utmost reach
stood dusky hemlocks , crowning the ascent
ABAB
have they not in the north sea 's blast
bowed to the waves the straining mast
their frozen sails the low , pale sun
of thule 's night has shone upon
AABB
flapped by the sea wind 's gusty sweep
round icy drift , and headland steep
wild jutland 's wives and lochlin 's daughters
have watched them fading o'er the waters
AABB
land of our fathers , in thine hour of need
god help thee , guarded by the passive creed
as the lone pilgrim trusts to beads and cowl
when through the forest rings the gray wolf 's howl
AABB
as the deep galleon trusts her gilded prow
when the black corsair slants athwart her bow
as the poor pheasant , with his peaceful mien
trusts to his feathers , shining golden green
AABB
when the dark plumage with the crimson beak
has rustled shadowy from its splintered peak
so trust thy friends , whose babbling tongues would charm
the lifted sabre from thy foeman 's arm
AABB
o ! it is pleasant , with a heart at ease
just after sunset , or by moonlight skies
to make the shifting clouds be what you please
or let the easily persuaded eyes
ABAB
own each quaint likeness issuing from the mould
of a friend 's fancy ; or with head bent low
and cheek aslant see rivers flow of gold
‘ twixt crimson banks ; and then , a traveller , go
ABAB
from mount to mount through cloudland , gorgeous land
or list'ning to the tide , with closed sight
be that blind bard , who on the chian strand
by those deep sounds possessed with inward light
ABAB
from mohawk 's mouth , far westing with the sun
thro all the midlands recent channels run
tap the redundant lakes , the broad hills brave
and hudson marry with missouri 's wave
AABB
from dim superior , whose uncounted sails
shade his full seas and bosom all his gales
new paths unfolding seek mackensie 's tide
and towns and empires rise along their side
AABB
slave 's crystal highways all his north adorn
like coruscations from the boreal morn
proud missisippi , tamed and taught his road
flings forth irriguous from his generous flood
AABB
master of human destinies am i
fame , love , and fortune on my footsteps wait
cities and fields i walk ; i penetrate
deserts and seas remote , and passing by
ABBA
hovel and mart and palace — soon or late
i knock , unbidden , once at every gate
if sleeping , wake — if feasting , rise before
i turn away . it is the hour of fate
AABB
and they who follow me reach every state
mortals desire , and conquer every foe
save death ; but those who doubt or hesitate
condemned to failure , penury , and woe
ABAB
‘ liza 's old man 's perhaps a little shady
‘ liza 's old woman 's prone to booze and cringe
but ‘ liza deems herself a perfect lady
and proves it in her feathers and her fringe
ABAB
for ‘ liza has a bloke her heart to cheer
with pearlies and a barrer and a jack
so all the vegetables of the year
are duly represented on her back
ABAB
her boots are sacrifices to her hats
which knock you speechless — like a load of bricks
her summer velvets dazzle wanstead flats
and cost , at times , a good eighteen and six
ABAB
then eviradnus , true to his intent
stripped to his utrecht jerkin ; but the while
he calmly had disarmed — with dexterous guile
had ladisl ä us seized a knife that lay
ABBA
and turned upon the murderous weapon there
and twisted it away ; then in a trice
his strong colossal hand grasped like a vice
the neck of ladisl ä us , who the blade
ABBA
roused though it be full often to a mood
which spurns the check of salutary bands
that this most famous stream in bogs and sands
should perish ; and to evil and to good
ABBA
be lost for ever . in our halls is hung
armoury of the invincible knights of old
we must be free or die , who speak the tongue
that shakespeare spake ; the faith and morals hold
ABAB
the prioress , this secret to disclose
appeared with spectacles upon her nose
and twenty nuns around a dress displayed
that convent mantua makers never made
AABB
imagine to yourself what felt the youth
‘ mid this examination of the truth
the nice proportions and the lily charms
soon raised within his bosom dire alarms
AABB
like magick operated on the string
and from it , what was tied , soon gave a spring
broke loose at once , just like a mettled steed
that , having slipt its halter , flies with speed
AABB
tell me then , ( for perhaps some one of you
yet here above him secretly doth hide
doo ye not feele your torments to accrewe
when ye sometimes behold the ruin 'd pride
ABAB
if thou hadst built some mighty instrument
and set thee down to utter ordered sound
whose faithful billows , from thy hands unbound
breaking in light , against our spirits went
ABBA
and caught , and bore above this earthly tent
the far strayed back to their prime natal ground
where all roots fast in harmony are found
and god sits thinking out a pure consent
ABBA
nay , that thou couldst not ; that was not for thee
our broken music thou must first restore
a harder task than think thine own out free
and till thou hast done it , no divinest score
ABAB
the larks are loud above our leagues of whin
now the sun 's perfume fills their glorious gold
with odour like the colour : all the wold
is only light and song and wind wherein
ABBA
these twain are blent in one with shining din
and now your gift , a giver 's kingly souled
dear old fast friend whose honours grow not old
bids memory 's note as loud and sweet begin
ABBA
though all but we from life be now gone forth
of that bright household in our joyous north
where i , scarce clear of boyhood just at end
first met your hand ; yet under life 's clear dome
AABB
but cowardly my heart submiss remaining
yields to receive what shaft thy fair eye darteth
well do i see thine eye my bale imparteth
and that save death no hope i am detaining
ABBA
for what is he can alter fortune 's sliding
one in his bed consumes his life away
other in wars , another in the sea
the like effects in me have their abiding
ABBA
above the spring tide sundawn of the year
a sunlike star , not born of day or night
filled the fair heaven of spring with heavenlier light
made of all ages orbed in one sole sphere
ABBA
whose light was as a titan 's smile or tear
then rose a ray more flowerlike , starry white
like a child 's eye grown lovelier with delight
sweet as a child 's heart lightening laugh to hear
ABBA
and last a fire from heaven , a fiery rain
as of god 's wrath on the unclean cities , fell
and lit the shuddering shades of half seen hell
that shrank before it and were cloven in twain
ABBA
struck with amaze , yet still to doubt inclined
he stands suspended , and explores his mind
“ what shall i do ? unhappy me ! who knows
but other gods intend me other woes
AABB
thus then i judge : while yet the planks sustain
the wild waves ’ fury , here i fix 'd remain
but , when their texture to the tempest yields
i launch adventurous on the liquid fields
AABB
the frog croaks loud , and maidens dare not pass
but fear the noisome toad and shun the grass
and on the sunny banks they dare not go
where hissing snakes run to the flood below
AABB
the nuthatch noises loud in wood and wild
like women turning skreeking to a child
the schoolboy hears and brushes through the trees
and runs about till drabbled to the knees
AABB
the old hawk winnows round the old crow 's nest
the schoolboy hears and wonder fills his breast
he throws his basket down to climb the tree
and wonders what the red blotched eggs can be
AABB
welcome , my pretty neddy — welcome too
thy merry rider with his apron blue
and thou , poor dog , most patient thing of all
begging for morsels that may never fall
AABB
oh ! ‘ tis a faithful group — and it might shame
painters of bold pretence , and greater name
to see how nature triumphs , and how rare
such matchless proofs of nature 's triumphs are
AABB
the smallest particle of sand may tell
with what rich ore pactolus ’ tide may swell
and woodward ! this ingenious , chaste design
proclaims what treasures lie within the mine
AABB
he kept his secret ; but the seed of crime
bursts of itself in god 's appointed time
the lives he wrecked were scattered far and wide
one never blamed nor wept ,— she only died
AABB
none knew his lot , though idle tongues would say
he sought a lonely refuge far away
and there , with borrowed name and altered mien
he died unheeded , as he lived unseen
AABB
the moral market had the usual chills
of virtue suffering from protested bills
the white cravats , to friendship 's memory true
sighed for the past , surveyed the future too
AABB
upon the path — when up the songs begin
full loud a moment and then low again
but when a day or two confirms her stay
boldly she sings and loud for half the day
AABB
they knelt in silent anguish by her bed
and could not weep ; but calmly there she lay
all pain had left her ; and the sun 's last ray
shone through upon her , warming into red
ABBA
the shady curtains . in her heart she said
“ heaven opens ; i leave these and go away
the bridegroom calls ,— shall the bride seek to stay
then low upon her breast she bowed her head
ABBA
o lily flower , o gem of priceless worth
o dove with patient voice and patient eyes
o fruitful vine amid a land of dearth
o maid replete with loving purities
ABAB
this binds thee , then , to farther my design
as i am bound by vow to farther thine
nor canst , nor darest thou , traitor , on the plain
appeach my honour , or thy own maintain
AABB
since thou art of my council , and the friend
whose faith i trust , and on whose care depend
and wouldst thou court my lady 's love , which i
much rather than release , would choose to die
AABB
but thou , false arcite , never shalt obtain
thy bad pretence ; i told thee first my pain
for first my love began ere thine was born
thou as my council , and my brother sworn
AABB
the world is too much with us ; late and soon
getting and spending , we lay waste our powers
little we see in nature that is ours
we have given our hearts away , a sordid boon
ABBA
this sea that bares her bosom to the moon
the winds that will be howling at all hours
and are up gathered now like sleeping flowers
for this , for every thing , we are out of tune
ABBA
it moves us not — great god ! i 'd rather be
a pagan suckled in a creed outworn
so might i , standing on this pleasant lea
have glimpses that would make me less forlorn
ABAB
when fresh aurora with her colours painted
mingled with spears of gold , the sun appearing
delights the hearts that are with love acquainted
and maying maids have then their time of cheering
ABAB
all creatures then with summer are delighted
the beasts , the birds , the fish with scale of silver
then stately dames by lovers are invited
to walk in meads or row upon the river
ABAB
she scanned the record of beethoven 's thought
and made the dumb chords speak both clear and low
and spread the dead man 's voice till i was caught
away , and now seemed long and long ago
ABAB
methought in tellus ’ bosom still i lay
while centuries like steeds tramped overhead
to the wild rhythms that , by night and day
from nature and man 's passions still are made
ABAB
the music of their motion as they pranced
lulled me to flawless ease as of a god
never upon me pain or pleasure chanced
unknown the dew of bliss , or fate 's hard rod
ABAB
the world is too much with us ; late and soon
getting and spending , we lay waste our powers
little we see in nature that is ours
we have given our hearts away , a sordid boon
ABBA
this sea that bares her bosom to the moon
the winds that will be howling at all hours
and are up gathered now like sleeping flowers
for this , for everything , we are out of tune
ABBA
it moves us not .— great god ! i 'd rather be
a pagan suckled in a creed outworn
so might i , standing on this pleasant lea
have glimpses that would make me less forlorn
ABAB
xiv . as the pent torrent in uneasy rest
under the griping rocks , doth ever keep
a monstrous working as it lies asleep
in the round hollow of some mountain 's breast
ABBA
till where it hideth in its sweltering nest
some earthquake finds it , and its waters leap
forth to the sunshine down the mighty steep
so in thee once was anguished forth the quest
ABBA
whereby man sought for life power as he lay
under his own proud heart and black despair
wedged fast and stifled up with loads of care
yet at dumb struggle with the tyrant clay
ABBA
some strange disaster , some reverse of fate
( ye gods avert it !) threats the trojan state
far be the omen which my thoughts suggest
but much i fear my hector ’ s dauntless breast
AABB
confronts achilles ; chased along the plain
shut from our walls ! i fear , i fear him slain
safe in the crowd he ever scorn ’ d to wait
and sought for glory in the jaws of fate
AABB
i must not grieve , my love , whose eyes would read
lines of delight , whereon her youth might smile
flowers have time before they come to seed
and she is young , and now must sport the while
ABAB
and sport , sweet maid , in season of these years
and learn to gather flowers before they wither
and where the sweetest blossom first appears
let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither
ABAB
lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air
and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise
pity and smiles do best become the fair
pity and smiles must only yield thee praise
ABAB
maintain your post : that 's all the fame you need
for ‘ tis impossible you should proceed
already i am worn with cares and age
and just abandoning the ungrateful stage
AABB
unprofitably kept at heaven 's expense
i live a rent charge on his providence
but you , whom every muse and grace adorn
whom i foresee to better fortune born
AABB
be kind to my remains ; and o defend
against your judgment , your departed friend
let not the insulting foe my fame pursue
but shade those laurels which descend to you
AABB
pity refusing my poor love to feed
a beggar starved for want of help he lies
and at your mouth , the door of beauty , cries
that thence some alms of sweet grants might proceed
ABBA
but as he waiteth for some alm è s deed
a cherry tree before the door he spies
“ o dear , ” quoth he , “ two cherries may suffice
two only may save life in this my need
ABBA
but beggars , can they nought but cherries eat
pardon my love , he is a goddess ’ son
and never feedeth but on dainty meat
else need he not to pine , as he hath done
ABAB
when i do count the clock that tells the time
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
when i behold the violet past prime
and sable curls all silvered o'er with white
ABAB
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summer 's green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
ABAB
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
and die as fast as they see others grow
ABAB
vain transitory splendors ! could not all
reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall
obscure it sinks , nor shall it more impart
an hour 's importance to the poor man 's heart
AABB
thither no more the peasant shall repair
to sweet oblivion of his daily care
no more the farmer 's news , the barber 's tale
no more the woodman 's ballad shall prevail
AABB
no more the smith his dusky brow shall clear
relax his ponderous strength , and lean to hear
the host himself no longer shall be found
careful to see the mantling bliss go round
AABB
are we , then , wholly fallen ? can it be
that thou , north wind , that from thy mountains bringest
their spirit to our plains , and thou , blue sea
who on our rocks thy wreaths of freedom flingest
ABAB
as on an altar ,— can it be that ye
have wasted inspiration on dead ears
dulled with the too familiar clank of chains
the people 's heart is like a harp for years
ABAB
“ not so , eurymachus : that no man draws
the wondrous bow , attend another cause
sacred to phoebus is the solemn day
which thoughtless we in games would waste away
AABB
till the next dawn this ill timed strife forego
and here leave fixed the ringlets in a row
now bid the sewer approach , and let us join
in due libations , and in rites divine
AABB
so end our night : before the day shall spring
the choicest offerings let melanthius bring
let then to phoebus ’ name the fatted thighs
feed the rich smokes high curling to the skies
AABB
o watcher at the guardless gate of kings
o doorkeeper that serving at their feast
hast in thine hand their doomsday drink , and seest
with eyeless sight the soul of unseen things
ABBA
thou in whose ear the dumb time coming sings
death , priest and king that makest of king and priest
a name , a dream , a less thing than the least
hover awhile above him with closed wings
ABBA
till the coiled soul , an evil snake shaped beast
eat its base bodily lair of flesh away
if haply , or ever its cursed life have ceased
or ever thy cold hands cover his head
ABAB
when thou shalt search thy glass nor find the flower
that there so long smiled gay , unwithering
and from sad vantage of a forlorn hour
that fore nor aft unmasks one hint of spring
ABAB
thou mourn'st the barrenness of beauty spent
with no reserv è d treasure for the day
when all that youth and sunny fortune lent
no more should light adoring eyes to thee
ABAB
he kept his secret ; but the seed of crime
bursts of itself in god 's appointed time
the lives he wrecked were scattered far and wide
one never blamed nor wept ,— she only died
AABB
none knew his lot , though idle tongues would say
he sought a lonely refuge far away
and there , with borrowed name and altered mien
he died unheeded , as he lived unseen
AABB
the moral market had the usual chills
of virtue suffering from protested bills
the white cravats , to friendship 's memory true
sighed for the past , surveyed the future too
AABB
in robes of tyrian blue the king was drest
a jewelled collar shone upon his breast
a giant ruby glittered in his crown
lord of rich lands and many a splendid town
AABB
in him the glories of an ancient line
of sober kings , who ruled by right divine
were centred ; and to him with loyal awe
the people looked for leadership and law
AABB
ten thousand knights , the safeguard of the land
lay like a single sword within his hand
a hundred courts , with power of life and death
proclaimed decrees of justice by his breath
AABB
afar in the desert i love to ride
with the silent bush boy alone by my side
o'er the brown karroo , where the bleating cry
of the springbok 's fawn sounds plaintively
AABB
and the timorous quagga 's shrill whistling neigh
is heard by the fountain at twilight gray
where the zebra wantonly tosses his mane
with wild hoof scouring the desolate plain
AABB
and the fleet footed ostrich over the waste
speeds like a horseman who travels in haste
hieing away to the home of her rest
where she and her mate have scooped their nest
AABB
the victim falls ; they strip the smoking hide
the beast they quarter , and the joints divide
then spread the tables , the repast prepare
each takes his seat , and each receives his share
AABB
the king himself ( an honorary sign
before great ajax placed the mighty chine
when now the rage of hunger was removed
nestor , in each persuasive art approved
AABB
full well the secrets of my soul she knew
better than e'er our parish priest could do
to her i told whatever could befall
had but my husband piss 'd against a wall
AABB
or done a thing that might have cost his life
she — and my niece — and one more worthy wife
had known it all : what most he would conceal
to these i made no scruple to reveal
AABB
at length a wedding much attention caught
the lads and lasses of the hamlet sought
to see the couple pass : the belle perceived
the very man for whom her bosom heaved
AABB
and loudly cried , behold scamander 's flood
which raised surprise ; soon numbers round her stood
astonishment expressed , but still the fair
whate'er was asked , would nothing more declare
AABB
than , in the spacious , blue , ethereal sky
her marriage would be soon , they might rely
a laugh prevailed ; for what was to be done
the god with hasty steps away had run
AABB
god 's child in christ adopted ,— christ my all
what that earth boasts were not lost cheaply , rather
than forfeit that blest name , by which i call
the holy one , the almighty god , my father
ABAB
father ! in christ we live , and christ in thee
eternal thou , and everlasting we
the heir of heaven , henceforth i fear not death
in christ i live ! in christ i draw the breath
AABB
of the true life !— let then earth , sea , and sky
make war against me ! on my heart i show
their mighty master 's seal . in vain they try
to end my life , that can but end its woe
ABAB
shall a man die before his dying day
death ? and for him though the utter day be nigh
not yet , not yet we give him leave to die
we give him grace not yet that men should say
ABBA
he is dead , wiped out , perished and past away
till the last bitterness of life go by
thou shalt not slay him ; till those last dregs run dry
o thou last lord of life ! thou shalt not slay
ABBA
let the lips live a little while and lie
the hand a little , and falter , and fail of strength
and the soul shudder and sicken at the sky
yea , let him live , though god nor man would let
ABAB
between us leapt a gold and scarlet flame
into the hollow of the cupped , arched blue
of heaven it rose . its flickering tongues up drew
and vanished in the sunshine . how it came
ABBA
we guessed not , nor what thing could be its name
from each to each had sprung those sparks which flew
together into fire . but we knew
the winds would slap and quench it in their game
ABBA
and so we graved and fashioned marble blocks
to treasure it , and placed them round about
with pillared porticos we wreathed the whole
and roofed it with bright bronze . behind carved locks
ABBA
shared first with them the bless è d void repose
of oily days at sea , when only rose
the porpoise 's slow wheel to break the sheen
of satin water indolently green
AABB
when for'ard the crew , caps tilted over eyes
lay heaped on deck ; slept ; mumbled ; smoked ; threw dice
the sleepy summer days ; the summer nights
( the coast pricked out with rings of harbour lights
AABB
the motionless nights , the vaulted nights of june
when high in the cordage drifts the entangled moon
and blocks go knocking , and the sheets go slapping
and lazy swells against the sides come lapping
AABB
the heart you hold too small and local thing
such spacious terms of edifice to bear
and yet , since poesy first shook out her wing
the mighty love has been impalaced there
ABAB
a dais for the sovereign lady spread
of many a lover , who the heaven would think
too low an awning for her sacred head
the world , from star to sea , cast down its brink
ABAB
no voice is heard , for man has fled the place
but terror crouches in the corners ’ space
and waits the coming guest . this banquet hall
of titans is so high , that he who shall
AABB
with wandering eye look up from beam to beam
of the confused wild roof will haply seem
to wonder that the stars he sees not there
giants the spiders are , that weave with care
AABB
their hideous webs , which float the joists amid
joists whose dark ends in griffins ’ jaws are hid
the light is lurid , and the air like death
and dark and foul . even night holds its breath
AABB
archbishop turpin , above the rest
spurred his steed to a jutting crest
his sermon thus to the franks he spake
“ lords , we are here for our monarch 's sake
AABB
cry mea culpa , and lowly kneel
i will assoil you , your souls to heal
in death ye are holy martyrs crowned
the franks alighted , and knelt on ground
AABB
misery , beyond all men 's most miserable
absolute , whole , defiant of defence
inevitable , inexplacable , intense
more vast than heaven is high , more deep than hell
ABBA
past cure or charm of solace or of spell
possesses and pervades the spirit and sense
whereto the expanse of the earth pays tribute ; whence
breeds evil only , and broods on fumes that swell
ABBA
rank from the blood of brother and mother and wife
‘ misery of miseries , all is misery , ’ saith
the heavy fair faced hateful head , at strife
with its own lusts that burn with feverous breath
ABAB
how do i love thee ? let me count the ways
i love thee to the depth and breadth and height
my soul can reach , when feeling out of sight
for the ends of being and ideal grace
ABBA
i love thee with the passion put to use
in my old griefs , and with my childhood 's faith
i love thee with a love i seemed to lose
with my lost saints ,— i love thee with the breath
ABAB
contending leaders at the word arose
each generous breast with emulation glows
so brave a task each ajax strove to share
bold merion strove , and nestor ’ s valiant heir
AABB
the spartan wish ’ d the second place to gain
and great ulysses wish ’ d , nor wish ’ d in vain
then thus the king of men the contest ends
“ thou first of warriors , and thou best of friends
AABB
undaunted diomed ! what chief to join
in this great enterprise , is only thine
just be thy choice , without affection made
to birth , or office , no respect be paid
AABB
as the bright flowers start from their wintry tomb
i 've sprung from the depths of futurity 's gloom
with the glory of hope on my unshadowed brow
but a fear at my heart , earth welcomes me now
AABB
i come and bear with me a measureless flow
of infinite joy and of infinite woe
the banquet 's light jest and the penitent prayer
the sweet laugh of gladness , the wail of despair
AABB
the warm words of welcome , and broken farewell
the strains of rich music , the funeral knell
the fair bridal wreath , and the robe for the dead
o how will they meet in the path i shall tread
AABB
unhappy wit , like most mistaken things
atones not for that envy which it brings
in youth alone its empty praise we boast
but soon the short lived vanity is lost
AABB
like some fair flower the early spring supplies
that gaily blooms , but even in blooming dies
what is this wit , which must our cares employ
the owner 's wife , that other men enjoy
AABB
then most our trouble still when most admired
and still the more we give , the more required
whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease
sure some to vex , but never all to please
AABB
be not displeased that these my papers should
bewray unto the world how fair thou art
or that my wits have showed the best they could
the chastest flame that ever warm è d heart
ABAB
think not , sweet delia , this shall be thy shame
my muse should sound thy praise with mournful warble
how many live , the glory of whose name
shall rest in ice , while thine is graved in marble
ABAB
thou mayst in after ages live esteemed
unburied in these lines , reserved in pureness
these shall entomb those eyes , that have redeemed
me from the vulgar , thee from all obscureness
ABAB
in silent horror o'er the boundless waste
the driver hassan with his camels past
one cruise of water on his back he bore
and his light scrip contain 'd a scanty store
AABB
a fan of painted feathers in his hand
to guard his shaded face from scorching sand
the sultry sun had gain 'd the middle sky
and not a tree , and not an herb was nigh
AABB
the beasts with pain their dusty way pursue
shrill roar 'd the winds , and dreary was the view
with desperate sorrow wild , the affrighted man
thrice sigh 'd , thrice struck his breast , and thus began
AABB
if thou survive my well contented day
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more re survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
ABAB
compare them with the bett'ring of the time
and though they be outstripped by every pen
reserve them for my love , not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
ABAB
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
‘ had my friend 's muse grown with this growing age
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage
ABAB
last , and not least of all these comforts is
the man that 's wedded unto some disease
a peevish , crazy , and a sickly wife
the burthen and the nusance of his life
AABB
her bed , the meer resemblance of a tomb
and an apothecarys shop her room
coughing and spitting all the night she lies
a very antidote to marriage joys
AABB
yet the poor man must bear with all these ills
besides the excessive charge of physick bills
a nurse , fine cordials , and a hundred things
until his substance she to little brings
AABB
what hast thou done , o womanhood of france
mother and daughter , sister , sweetheart , wife
what hast thou done , amid this fateful strife
to prove the pride of thine inheritance
ABBA
in this fair land of freedom and romance
i hear thy voice with tears and courage rife
smiling against the swords that seek thy life
make answer in a noble utterance
ABBA
“ i give france all i have , and all she asks
would it were more ! ah , let her ask and take
my hands to nurse her wounded , do her tasks
my feet to run her errands through the dark
ABAB
he held no dream worth waking : so he said
he who stands now on death 's triumphal steep
awakened out of life wherein we sleep
and dream of what he knows and sees , being dead
ABBA
but never death for him was dark or dread
“ look forth ” he bade the soul , and fear not . weep
all ye that trust not in his truth , and keep
vain memory 's vision of a vanished head
ABBA
as all that lives of all that once was he
save that which lightens from his word : but we
who , seeing the sunset coloured waters roll
yet know the sun subdued not of the sea
AABB
thou who didst make and knowest whereof we are made
oh bear in mind our dust and nothingness
our wordless tearless dumbness of distress
bear thou in mind the burden thou hast laid
ABBA
upon us , and our feebleness unstayed
except thou stay us : for the long long race
which stretches far and far before our face
thou knowest ,— remember thou whereof we are made
ABBA
if making makes us thine , then thine we are
and if redemption , we are twice thine own
if once thou didst come down from heaven afar
to seek us and to find us , how not save
ABAB
the learned teacher satisfaction showed
that such success from his instructions flowed
laughed heartily at husbands , silly wights
who had not wit to guard connubial rights
AABB
and from their lamb the wily wolf to keep
a shepherd will o'erlook a hundred sheep
while foolish man 's unable to protect
e'en one where most he 'd wish to be correct
AABB
howe'er , this care he thought was somewhat hard
but not a thing impossible to guard
and if he had not got a hundred eyes
thank heav'n , his wife , though cunning to devise
AABB
the heavens beheld the beauty of my queen
and all amazed , to wonder thus began
“ why dotes not jove , as erst we all have seen
and shapes himself like to a seemly man
ABAB
mean are the matches which he sought before
like bloomless buds , too base to make compare
and she alone hath treasured beauty 's store
in whom all gifts and princely graces are
ABAB
cupid replied : “ i posted with the sun
to view the maids that liv è d in those days
and none there was that might not well be won
but she , most hard , most cold , made of delays
ABAB
amazed at what the lordly devil said
the clod could naught reply , so great his dread
but at the gasconade perretta smiled
who kept his house and weary hours beguiled
AABB
a sprightly clever lass , with prying eye
who , when a shepherdess , could more descry
than sheep or lambs she watched upon the plain
if other views or points she sought to gain
AABB
said she , weep not , i 'll undertake at ease
to gull this novice devil as i please
he 's young and ignorant ; has nothing seen
thee ; from his rage , i thoroughly will skreen
AABB
methinks i see thee , lying calm and low
silent and dark within thy earthy bed
thy mighty hands , in which i trusted , dead
resting , with thy long arms , from work or blow
ABBA
and the night robe , around thy tall form , flow
down from the kingly face , and from the head
save by its thick dark curls , uncovered
my brother , dear from childhood , lying so
ABBA
not often since thou went'st , i think of thee
( with inward cares and questionings oppressed
and yet , ere long , i seek thee in thy rest
and bring thee home my heart , as full , as free
ABBA
when comes the lighted day for men to read
life 's meaning , with the work before their hands
till this good gift of breath from debt is freed
earth will not hear her children 's wailful bands
ABAB
deplore the chieftain fall'n in sob and dirge
nor they look where is darkness , but on high
the sun that dropped down our horizon 's verge
illumes his labours through the travelled sky
ABAB
now seen in sum , most glorious ; and ‘ tis known
by what our warrior wrought we hold him fast
a splendid image built of man has flown
his deeds inspired of god outstep a past
ABAB
returning from its daily quest , my spirit
changed thoughts and vile in thee doth weep to find
it grieves me that thy mild and gentle mind
those ample virtues which it did inherit
ABBA
has lost . once thou didst loathe the multitude
of blind and madding men — i then loved thee
i loved thy lofty songs and that sweet mood
when thou wert faithful to thyself and me
ABAB
i must not grieve my love , whose eyes would read
lines of delight , whereon her youth might smile
flowers have a time before they come to seed
and she is young , and now must sport the while
ABAB
ah sport , sweet maid , in season of these years
and learn to gather flowers before they wither
and where the sweetest blossoms first appears
let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither
ABAB
lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air
and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise
pity and smiles do best become the fair
pity and smiles shall yield thee lasting praise
ABAB
to drift with every passion till my soul
is a stringed lute on which all winds can play
is it for this that i have given away
mine ancient wisdom , and austere control
ABBA
methinks my life is a twice written scroll
scrawled over on some boyish holiday
with idle songs for pipe and virelay
which do but mar the secret of the whole
ABBA
surely there was a time i might have trod
the sunlit heights , and from life 's dissonance
struck one clear chord to reach the ears of god
is that time dead ? lo ! with a little rod
AABB
think not , because i wonder where you fled
that i would lift a pin to see you there
you may , for me , be prowling anywhere
so long as you show not your little head
ABBA
no dark and evil story of the dead
would leave you less pernicious or less fair
not even lilith , with her famous hair
and lilith was the devil , i have read
ABBA
i cannot hate you , for i loved you then
the woods were golden then . there was a road
through beeches ; and i said their smooth feet showed
like yours . truth must have heard me from afar
ABBA
the woman singeth at her spinning wheel
a pleasant chant , ballad , or baracolle
she thinketh of her song , upon the whole
far more than of her flax ; and yet the reel
ABBA
is full , and artfully her fingers feel
with quick adjustment , provident control
the lines , too subtly twisted to unroll
out to a perfect thread . i hence appeal
ABBA
to the dear christian church , that we may do
our father 's business in these temples mirk
thus , swift and steadfast ; thus , intent and strong
while , thus , apart from toil , our souls pursue
ABBA
the clock chimed three , and we yet strayed at will
about the yard in morning dishabille
when aunt ruth came , with apron o'er her head
holding a letter in her hand , and said
AABB
“ here is a note , from vivian i opine
at least his servant brought it . and now , girls
you may think this is no concern of mine
but in my day young ladies did not go
ABAB
till almost bed time roaming to and fro
in morning wrappers , and with tangled curls
the very pictures of forlorn distress
‘ tis three o'clock , and time for you to dress
AABB
the lone man gazed and gazed upon his gold
his sweat , his blood , the wage of weary days
but now how sweet , how doubly sweet to hold
all gay and gleamy to the campfire blaze
ABAB
the evening sky was sinister and cold
the willows shivered , wanly lay the snow
the uncommiserating land , so old
so worn , so grey , so niggard in its woe
ABAB
peered through its ragged shroud . the lone man sighed
poured back the gaudy dust into its poke
gazed at the seething river listless eyed
loaded his corn cob pipe as if to smoke
ABAB
nor deem he lived unto himself alone
his was the public spirit of his sire
and in those eyes , soft with domestic fire
a quenchless light of fiercer temper shone
ABBA
what time about , the world our shame was blown
on every wind ; his soul would not conspire
with selfish men to soothe the mob 's desire
veiling with garlands moloch 's bloody stone
ABBA
the high bred instincts of a better day
ruled in his blood , when to be citizen
rang roman yet , and a free people 's sway
was not the exchequer of impoverished men
ABAB
yes , childhood , thee no rankling woes pursue
no forms of future ill salute thy view
no pangs repentant bid thee wake to weep
but halcyon peace protects thy downy sleep
AABB
and sanguine hope , through every storm of life
shoots her bright beams , and calms the internal strife
yet e'en round childhood 's heart , a thoughtless shrine
affection 's little thread will ever twine
AABB
and though but frail may seem each tender tie
the soul foregoes them but with many a sigh
thus , when the long expected moment came
when forced to leave the gentle hearted dame
AABB
he looked half parson and half skipper : a quaint
beautiful blend , with blue eyes good to see
and old world whiskers . you found him cynic , saint
salt , humourist , christian , poet ; with a free
ABAB
far glancing , luminous utterance ; and a heart
large as st. francis 's : withal a brain
stored with experience , letters , fancy , art
and scored with runes of human joy and pain
ABAB
till six and sixty years he used his gift
his gift unparalleled , of laughter and tears
and left the world a high piled , golden drift
of verse : to grow more golden with the years
ABAB
continued john :— now i will thee instruct
the proper manner , matters to conduct
for thee to have a clever mare by day
and still at night a charming wife survey
AABB
face , legs , and ev'ry thing shall reappear
come , see it done , and i 'll perform it here
thou'lt then the method fully comprehend
but hold thy tongue , or all will quickly end
AABB
a single word the magick would dispel
and , during life , no more with us ‘ twould dwell
keep close thy mouth and merely ope ’ thy eyes
a glimpse alone to learn it will suffice
AABB
ye , whose high worths surpassing paragon
could not on earth have found one fit for mate
ne but in heaven matchable to none
why did ye stoup unto so lowly state
ABAB
but ye thereby much greater glory gate
then had ye sorted with a princes pere
for now your light doth more it selfe dilate
and , in my darknesse , greater doth appeare
ABAB
the morning road is thronged with merry boys
who seek the water for their sunday joys
they run to seek the shallow pit , and wade
and dance about the water in the shade
AABB
the boldest ventures first and dashes in
and others go and follow to the chin
and duck about , and try to lose their fears
and laugh to hear the thunder in their ears
AABB
they bundle up the rushes for a boat
and try across the deepest place to float
beneath the willow trees they ride and stoop
the awkward load will scarcely bear them up
AABB
to fly from vice is virtue : to be free
from foolishness is wisdom 's first degree
think of some ill you feel a real disgrace
the loss of money or the loss of place
AABB
to keep yourself from these , how keen the strain
how dire the sweat of body and of brain
through tropic heat , o'er rocks and seas you run
to furthest india , poverty to shun
AABB
yet scorn the sage who offers you release
from vagrant wishes that disturb your peace
take some provincial pugilist , who gains
a paltry cross way prize for all his pains
AABB
if he be dead , in whom no heart remains
or lifeless be in whom no life is found
if he do pine that never comfort gains
and be distressed that hath his deadly wound
ABAB
then must i die whose heart elsewhere is clad
and lifeless pass the greedy worms to feed
then must i pine that never comfort had
and be distressed whose wound with tears doth bleed
ABAB
which if i do , why do i not wax cold
why rest i not like one that wants a heart
why move i still like him that life doth hold
and sense enjoy both of my joy and smart
ABAB
he said ; and , straining , heaved him off the ground
with matchless strength ; that time ulysses found
the strength to evade , and where the nerves combine
his ankle struck : the giant fell supine
AABB
ulysses , following , on his bosom lies
shouts of applause run rattling through the skies
ajax to lift ulysses next essays
he barely stirr ’ d him , but he could not raise
AABB
his knee lock ’ d fast , the foe ’ s attempt denied
and grappling close , they tumbled side by side
defiled with honourable dust they roll
still breathing strife , and unsubdued of soul
AABB
“ despairless ? hopeless ? join the cheerful hunt
whose hounds are science , high desires the steeds
and misery the quarry . use and wont
no help to human anguish bring , that bleeds
ABAB
for all two thousand years of christian deeds
let use and wont in styes still feed and grunt
or , bovine , graze knee deep in flowering meads
mount ! follow ! onward urge life 's dragon hunt
ABAB
— so cries the sportsman brisk at break of day
“ the sound of hound and horn is well for thee
thus i reply , “ but i have other prey
and friendly is my quest as you may see
ABAB
“ ho ! the warrior that scorneth the foe and fire
hey ó ka will crown with his heart 's desire
he snatched from the embers a red hot brand
and held it aloft in his naked hand
AABB
then grant me , wak â wa , my heart 's desire
let the sunlight shine in my lonely tee
i laugh at red death and i laugh at red fire
brave red cloud is only afraid of fear
ABAB
i am not one who much or oft delight
to season my fireside with personal talk
about friends , who live within an easy walk
or neighbours , daily , weekly , in my sight
ABBA
and , for my chance acquaintance , ladies bright
sons , mothers , maidens withering on the stalk
these all wear out of me , like forms , with chalk
painted on rich men 's floors , for one feast night
ABBA
better than such discourse doth silence long
long , barren silence , square with my desire
to sit without emotion , hope , or aim
by my half kitchen my half parlour fire
ABAB
fair isle , that from the fairest of all flowers
thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take
how many memories of what radiant hours
at sight of thee and thine at once awake
ABAB
how many scenes of what departed bliss
how many thoughts of what entombed hopes
how many visions of a maiden that is
no more — no more upon thy verdant slopes
ABAB
no more ! alas , that magical sad sound
transfomring all ! thy charms shall please no more
thy memory no more ! accursed ground
henceforth i hold thy flower enamelled shore
ABAB
with how sad steps , o moon ! thou climb'st the skies
how silently , and with how wan a face
what ! may it be , that even in heavenly place
that busy archer his sharp arrows tries
ABBA
sure , if that long with love acquainted eyes
can judge of love , thou feel'st a lover 's case
i read it in thy looks ; thy languish 'd grace
to me that feel the like , thy state descries
ABBA
then , even of fellowship , o moon , tell me
is constant love deem 'd there but want of wit
are beauties there as proud as here they be
do they above love to be loved , and yet
ABAB
a harry of hoofs in a village street
a shape in the moonlight , a bulk in the dark
and beneath from the pebbles , in passing , a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet
ABBA
that was all ! and yet , through the gloom and the light
the fate of a nation was riding that night
and the spark struck out by that steed , in his flight
kindled the land into flame with its heat
AABB
he has left the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him , tranquil and broad and deep
is the mystic , meeting the ocean tides
and under the alders , that skirt its edge
AABB
meek twilight ! soften the declining day
and bring the hour my pensive spirit loves
when , o'er the mountain flow descends the ray
that gives to silence the deserted groves
ABAB
ah , let the happy court the morning still
when , in her blooming loveliness array 'd
she bids fresh beauty light the vale , or hill
and rapture warble in the vocal shade
ABAB
sweet is the odour of the morning 's flower
and rich in melody her accents rise
yet dearer to my soul the shadowy hour
at which her blossoms close , her music dies
ABAB
among the taller wood with ivy hung
the old fox plays and dances round her young
she snuffs and barks if any passes bye
and swings her tail and turns prepared to fly
AABB
the horseman hurries bye , she bolts to see
and turns agen , from danger never free
if any stands she runs among the poles
and barks and snaps and drives them in the holes
AABB
the shepherd sees them and the boy goes bye
and gets a stick and progs the hole to try
they get all still and lie in safety sure
and out again when every thing 's secure
AABB
inland , within a hollow vale , i stood
and saw , while sea was calm and air was clear
the coast of france , the coast of france how near
drawn almost into frightful neighbourhood
ABBA
i shrunk , for verily the barrier flood
was like a lake , or river bright and fair
a span of waters ; yet what power is there
what mightiness for evil and for good
ABBA
even so doth god protect us if we be
virtuous and wise : winds blow , and waters roll
strength to the brave , and power , and deity
yet in themselves are nothing ! one decree
ABBA
a dimness of a glory glimmers here
thro ’ veils and distance from the space remote
a faintest far vibration of a note
reaches to us and seems to bring us near
ABBA
causing our face to glow with braver cheer
making the serried mist to stand afloat
subduing langour with an antidote
and strengthening love almost to cast out fear
ABBA
till for one moment golden city walls
rise looming on us , golden walls of home
light of our eyes until the darkness falls
then thro ’ the outer darkness burdensome
ABAB
“ ‘ tis strange what very strong advising
by word of mouth , or advertising
by chalking on walls , or placarding on vans
with fifty other different plans
AABB
the very high pressure , in fact , of pressing
it needs to persuade one to purchase a blessing
whether the soothing american syrup
a safety hat , or a safety stirrup
AABB
infallible pills for the human frame
or rowland 's o don'thypppheno ( an ominous name
a doudney 's suit which the shape so hits
that it beats all others into fits
AABB
‘ tis heaven — not man — must charm away the woe
which bursts when nature 's feelings newly flow
yet tenderness and time may rob the tear
of half its bitterness for one so dear
AABB
a nation 's gratitude perchance may spread
a thornless pillow for the widowed head
may lighten well her heart 's maternal care
and wean from penury the soldier 's heir
AABB
or deem to living war worn valour just
each wounded remnant — albion 's cherished trust
warm his decline with those endearing rays
whose bounteous sunshine yet may gild his days
AABB
whilst youth and error led my wandering mind
and set my thoughts in heedless ways to range
all unawares a goddess chaste i find
diana like , to work my sudden change
ABAB
for her , no sooner had mine eye bewrayed
but with disdain to see me in that place
with fairest hand the sweet unkindest maid
casts water cold disdain upon my face
ABAB
which turned my sport into a hart 's despair
which still is chased , while i have any breath
by mine own thoughts set on me by my fair
my thoughts like hounds pursue me to my death
ABAB
ever mine own , while moons and seasons bring
from crudeness ripeness mellow and sanative
ever mine own , till death shall ply his sieve
and still mine own , when saints break grave and sing
ABBA
and this myself as king unto my king
i give , to him who gave himself for me
who gives himself to me , and bids me sing
a sweet new song of his redeemed set free
ABAB
lady , in beauty and in favour rare
of favour , not of due , i favour crave
nature to thee beauty and favour gave
fair then thou art , and favour thou may'st spare
ABBA
my loss of life a million fold were less
than the least loss should unto you befall
yet grant this gift ; which gift when i possess
both i have life and you no loss at all
ABAB
the green mounds of the village burial place
where , pondering how all human love and hate
find one sad level ; and how , soon or late
wronged and wrongdoer , each with meekened face
ABBA
and cold hands folded over a still heart
pass the green threshold of our common grave
whither all footsteps tend , whence none depart
awed for myself , and pitying my race
ABAB
when in the mines of dark and silent thought
sometimes i delve and find strange fancies there
with heavy labour to the surface brought
that lie and mock me in the brighter air
ABAB
poor ores from starv è d lodes of poverty
unfit for working or to be refined
that in the darkness cheat the miner 's eye
i turn away from that base cave , the mind
ABAB
yet had i but the power to crush the stone
there are strange metals hid in flakes therein
each flake a spark sole hidden and alone
that only cunning , toilsome chemists win
ABAB
a light wind , from the open casement , fanned
my brow and helen 's , as we , hand in hand
sat looking out upon the twilight scene
in dreamy silence . helen 's dark blue eyes
AABB
like two lost stars that wandered from the skies
some night adown the meteor 's shining track
and always had been grieving to go back
now gazed up , wistfully , at heaven 's dome
ABBA
and seemed to recognize and long for home
her sweet voice broke the silence : “ wish , maurine
before you speak ! you know the moon is new
and anything you wish for will come true
AABB
the sky overhead with lowering clouds is cast
which anu in his rage above them massed
dark tempests fly above from rimmon 's breath
who hovers o'er them with the gods of death
AABB
the wicked seven winds howl wildly round
and crashing cedars falling shake the ground
now tsil lattu her black wings spreads o'er all
dark shrouding all the forest with her pall
AABB
and from his steed for safety each dismounts
and o'er their heads now break the ebon founts
but hark ! what is that dreadful roaring noise
the dragons come ! their flaming crests they poise
AABB
the boy that goes to fodder with surprise
walks oer the gate he opened yesternight
the hedges all have vanished from his eyes
een some tree tops the sheep could reach to bite
ABAB
the novel scene emboldens new delight
and , though with cautious steps his sports begin
he bolder shuffles the huge hills of snow
till down he drops and plunges to the chin
ABAB
and struggles much and oft escape to win
then turns and laughs but dare not further go
for deep the grass and bushes lie below
where little birds that soon at eve went in
ABBA
o for my sake do you with fortune chide
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
ABAB
thence comes it that my name receives a brand
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in , like the dyer 's hand
pity me then , and wish i were renewed
ABAB
whilst like a willing patient i will drink
potions of eisel ‘ gainst my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think
nor double penance to correct correction
ABAB
his beat lies knee high through a dust of story
a dust of terror and torture , grief and crime
ghosts that are england 's wonder , and shame , and glory
throng where he walks , an antic of old time
ABAB
a sense of long immedicable tears
were ever with him , could his ears but heed
the stern hic jacets of our bloodiest years
are for his reading , had he eyes to read
ABAB
but here , where crookback raged , and cranmer trimmed
and more and strafford faced the axe 's proving
he shows that crown the desperate colonel nimmed
or simply keeps the country cousin moving
ABAB
reader , didst ever see a water spout
‘ tis possible that thou wilt answer , “ no
well then ! he makes a most infernal rout
sucks , like an elephant , the waves below
ABAB
with huge proboscis reaching from the sky
as if he meant to drink the ocean dry
at length so full he can n't hold one drop more
he bursts down rush the waters with a roar
AABB
on some poor boat , or sloop , or brig , or ship
and almost sinks the wand'rer of the deep
thus have i seen a monarch at reviews
suck from the tribe of officers the news
AABB
o how i faint when i of you do write
knowing a better spirit doth use your name
and in the praise thereof spends all his might
to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame
ABAB
but since your worth ( wide as the ocean is
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear
my saucy bark ( inferior far to his
on your broad main doth wilfully appear
ABAB
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
or ( being wrecked ) i am a worthless boat
he of tall building , and of goodly pride
ABAB
thus is the panther neither loved nor fear 'd
a mere mock queen of a divided herd
whom soon by lawful power she might control
herself a part submitted to the whole
AABB
then , as the moon who first receives the light
by which she makes our nether regions bright
so might she shine , reflecting from afar
the rays she borrow 'd from a better star
AABB
big with the beams which from her mother flow
and reigning o'er the rising tides below
now , mixing with a savage crowd , she goes
and meanly flatters her inveterate foes
AABB
bless è d that flock safe penned in paradise
bless è d this flock which tramps in weary ways
all form one flock , god 's flock ; all yield him praise
by joy or pain , still tending toward the prize
ABBA
joy speaks in praises there , and sings and flies
where no night is , exulting all its days
here , pain finds solace , for , behold , it prays
in both love lives the life that never dies
ABBA
here life is the beginning of our death
and death the starting point whence life ensues
surely our life is death , our death is life
nor need we lay to heart our peace or strife
AABB
the hour for which men hungered and had thirst
and dying were loth to die before it came
is it indeed upon thee ? and the lame
late foot of vengeance on thy trace accurst
ABBA
for years insepulchred and crimes inhearsed
for days marked red or black with blood or shame
hath it outrun thee to tread out thy name
this scourge , this hour , is this indeed the worst
ABBA
o clothed and crowned with curses , canst thou tell
have thy dead whispered to thee what they see
whose eyes are open in the dark on thee
ere spotted soul and body take farewell
ABBA
throughout the echoing chambers of my brain
i hear your words in mournful cadence toll
like some slow passing bell which warns the soul
of sundering darkness . unrelenting , fain
ABBA
to batter down resistance , fall again
stroke after stroke , insistent diastole
the bitter blows of truth , until the whole
is hammered into fact made strangely plain
ABBA
where shall i look for comfort ? not to you
our worlds are drawn apart , our spirit 's suns
divided , and the light of mine burnt dim
now in the haunted twilight i must do
ABBA
a carver , having loved too long in vain
hewed out the portraiture of venus ’ son
in marble rock , upon the which did rain
small drizzling drops , that from a fount did run
ABAB
imagining the drops would either wear
his fury out , or quench his living flame
but when he saw it bootless did appear
he swore the water did augment the same
ABAB
so i , that seek in verse to carve thee out
hoping thy beauty will my flame allay
viewing my verse and poems all throughout
find my will rather to my love obey
ABAB
with sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone
ever put on ; a miserable crowd
sick , hale , old , young , who cried before that cloud
“ thou art our king , o death ! to thee we groan
ABBA
i seem 'd to mount those steps ; the vapours gave
smooth way ; and i beheld the face of one
sleeping alone within a mossy cave
with her face up to heaven ; that seem 'd to have
ABAB
yea , this is he , whose name is synonym
of all that 's noble , though but lowly born
who took command upon a stormy morn
when few had hope . although uncouth of limb
ABBA
homely of face and gaunt , but never grim
beautiful he was with that which none may scorn
with love of god and man and things forlorn
and freedom mighty as the soul in him
ABBA
then do i love and draw this weary breath
for her , the cruel fair , within whose brow
i written find the sentence of my death
in unkind letters wrote she cares not how
ABAB
thou power that rul'st the confines of the night
laughter loving goddess , worldly pleasures ’ queen
intenerate that heart that sets so light
the truest love that ever yet was seen
ABAB
and cause her leave to triumph in this wise
upon the prostrate spoil of that poor heart
that serves , a trophy to her conquering eyes
and must their glory to the world impart
ABAB
wrongs , injuries , from many a darksome den
now , gay in hope , explore the paths of men
see from his cavern grim oppression rise
and throw on poverty his cruel eyes
AABB
keen on the helpless victim see him fly
and stifle , dark , the feebly bursting cry
mark ruffian violence , distained with crimes
rousing elate in these degenerate times
AABB
view unsuspecting innocence a prey
as guileful fraud points out the erring way
while subtle litigation 's pliant tongue
the life blood equal sucks of right and wrong
AABB
in ida vale three queens the shepherd saw
queens of esteem , divine they were all three
a sight of worth . but i a wonder shaw
their virtues all in one alone to be
ABAB
licia the fair , surpassing venus ’ pride
( the matchless queen , commander of the gods
when drawn with doves she in her pomp doth ride
hath far more beauty , and more grace by odds
ABAB
juno , jove 's wife , unmeet to make compare
i grant a goddess , but not half so mild
minerva wise , a virtue , but not rare
yet these are mean , if that my love but smiled
ABAB
one might believe that natural miseries
had blasted france , and made of it a land
unfit for men ; and that in one great band
her sons were bursting forth , to dwell at ease
ABBA
but ‘ tis a chosen soil , where sun and breeze
shed gentle favours : rural works are there
and ordinary business without care
spot rich in all things that can soothe and please
ABBA
how piteous then that there should be such dearth
of knowledge ; that whole myriads should unite
to work against themselves such fell despite
should come in phrensy and in drunken mirth
ABBA
sweet wreck of loveliness ! alas , how soon
the sad brief summer of thy joys hath fled
how sorrow 's friendship for thy hapless doom
thy beauty faded , and thy hopes all dead
ABAB
oh ! ‘ twas that beauty 's pow'r which first destroy 'd
thy mind 's serenity ; its charms but led
the faithless friend , that thy pure love enjoy 'd
to tear the blooming blossom from its bed
ABAB
how reason shudders at thy frenzied air
to see thee smile , with fancy 's dreams possess 'd
or shrink , the frozen image of despair
or love enraptur 'd , chaunt thy griefs to rest
ABAB
tell me , when shall these wearie woes have end
or shall their ruthlesse torment never cease
but al my days in pining languor spend
without hope of asswagement or release
ABAB
we feel and see with different hearts and eyes
ah christ , if all our hearts could meet in thee
how well it were for them and well for me
our hearts thy dear accepted sacrifice
ABBA
thou , only life of hearts and light of eyes
our life , our light , if once we turn to thee
so be it , o lord , to them and so to me
be all alike thine own dear sacrifice
ABBA
thou who by death hast ransomed us from death
thyself god 's sole well pleasing sacrifice
thine only sacred self i plead with thee
make thou it well for them and well for me
AABB
i had no thought of violets of late
the wild , shy kind that spring beneath your feet
in wistful april days , when lovers mate
and wander through the fields in raptures sweet
ABAB
the thought of violets meant florists ’ shops
and bows and pins , and perfumed papers fine
and garish lights , and mincing little fops
and cabarets and songs , and deadening wine
ABAB
so far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed
i had forgot wide fields , and clear brown streams
the perfect loveliness that god has made
wild violets shy and heaven mounting dreams
ABAB
shot up from broad rank blades that droop below
the nodding wheat ear forms a graceful bow
with milky kernels starting full , weigh 'd down
ere yet the sun hath ting 'd its head with brown
AABB
whilst thousands in a flock , for ever gay
loud chirping sparrows welcome on the day
and from the mazes of the leafy thorn
drop one by one upon the bending corn
AABB
giles with a pole assails their close retreats
and round the grass grown dewy border beats
on either side completely overspread
here branches bend , there corn o'ertops his head
AABB
those who have tact their poverty to mask
before their chief get more than those who ask
it makes , you see , a difference , if you take
as modest people do , or snatch your cake
AABB
yet that 's the point from which our question starts
by what way best to get at patrons ’ hearts
“ my mother 's poor , my sister 's dower is due
my farm wo n't sell or yield us corn enow
AABB
what is all this but just the beggar 's cry
“ i 'm starving ; give me food for charity
“ ah ! ” whines another in a minor key
“ the loaf 's in out ; pray spare a slice for me
AABB
ah , was it yrma with those radiant eyes
that came to greet and lead him through the skies
ay ; all the world was one wide rose white flame
as down the path to meet him yrma came
AABB
and caught the child up in her arms and cried
this is my child that moved in etain 's side
thy child and etain 's : i the unknown ideal
and she the rich , the incarnate , breathing real
AABB
are one ; for me thou never canst attain
but by the love i yield thee for etain
even as through christ thy soul allays its dearth
love 's heaven is only compassed upon earth
AABB
i know the sorrows of the last abyss
i walked the cold black pools without a star
i lay on rock of unseen flint and spar
i heard the execrable serpent hiss
ABBA
i dreamed of sun , fruit tree , and virgin 's kiss
i woke alone with midnight near and far
and everlasting hunger , keen to mar
but i arose , and my reward is this
ABBA
i am no more one more amid the throng
though name be naught , and lips forever weak
i seem to know at last of mighty song
and with no blush , no tremor on the cheek
ABAB
hail , twilight , sovereign of one peaceful hour
not dull art thou as undiscerning night
but studious only to remove from sight
day 's mutable distinctions .— ancient power
ABBA
thus did the waters gleam , the mountains lower
to the rude briton , when , in wolf skin vest
here roving wild , he laid him down to rest
on the bare rock , or through a leafy bower
ABBA
looked ere his eyes were closed . by him was seen
the self same vision which we now behold
at thy meek bidding , shadowy power ! brought forth
these mighty barriers , and the gulf between
ABBA
as when above orchestral undertone
the plaining wail of muted violin
the hushed ob ö e and the distant din
of muffled drum or viol 's raucous groan
ABBA
sudden arises one pure voice like tone
a silver trumpet 's tongue that stirs the soul
to feel the theme , and the harmonious whole
a sonant setting seems for that alone
ABBA
so , high above earth 's murmurous stir and strife
riseth thy voice in clear enringing song
no minor plaint of dull despairing pain
but one true note of hope that bids us long
ABAB
so drives self love , through just and through unjust
to one man 's power , ambition , lucre , lust
the same self love , in all , becomes the cause
of what restrains him , government and laws
AABB
for , what one likes , if others like as well
what serves one will , when many wills rebel
how shall he keep what , sleeping or awake
a weaker may surprise , a stronger take
AABB
his safety must his liberty restrain
all join to guard what each desires to gain
forced into virtue thus by self defence
even kings learn 'd justice and benevolence
AABB
penelope , for her ulisses sake
deviz 'd a web her wooers to deceave
in which the worke that she all day did make
the same at night she did againe unreave
ABAB
that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruined choirs , where late the sweet birds sang
ABAB
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west
which by and by black night doth take away
death 's second self that seals up all in rest
ABAB
in me thou seest the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the death bed , whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourished by
ABAB
ii . and in these lines my purpose is to show
that he who left the father , though he came
not with art splendour or the earthly flame
of genius , yet in that he did bestow
ABBA
his own true loving heart , did cause to grow
unseen and buried deep , whate'er we name
the best in human art , without the shame
of idle sitting in most real woe
ABBA
and that whate'er of beautiful and grand
the earth contains , by him was not despised
but rather was so deeply realized
in word and deed , though not with artist hand
ABBA
there was a day when death to me meant tears
and tearful takings leave that had to be
and awed embarkings on an unshored sea
and sudden disarrangement of the years
ABBA
but now i know that nothing interferes
with the fixed forces when a tired man dies
that death is only answerings and replies
the chiming of a bell which no one hears
ABBA
the casual slanting of a half spent sun
the soft recessional of noise and coil
the coveted something time nor age can spoil
i know it is a fabric finely spun
ABBA
uncivil sickness , hast thou no regard
but dost presume my dearest to molest
and without leave dar'st enter in that breast
whereto sweet love approach yet never dared
ABBA
eudorus next ; whom polymele the gay
famed in the graceful dance , produced to day
her , sly cellenius loved : on her would gaze
as with swift step she form ’ d the running maze
AABB
to her high chamber from diana ’ s quire
the god pursued her , urged , and crown ’ d his fire
the son confess ’ d his father ’ s heavenly race
and heir ’ d his mother ’ s swiftness in the chase
AABB
strong echecleus , bless ’ d in all those charms
that pleased a god , succeeded to her arms
not conscious of those loves , long hid from fame
with gifts of price he sought and won the dame
AABB
the more i 've viewed this world the more i 've found
that , filled as ‘ tis with scenes and creatures rare
fancy commands within her own bright round
a world of scenes and creatures far more fair
ABAB
nor is it that her power can call up there
a single charm , that 's not from nature won
no more than rainbows in their pride can wear
a single hue unborrowed from the sun
ABAB
o world , thou choosest not the better part
it is not wisdom to be only wise
and on the inward vision close the eyes
but it is wisdom to believe the heart
ABBA
columbus found a world , and had no chart
save one that faith deciphered in the skies
to trust the soul 's invincible surmise
was all his science and his only art
ABBA
our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine
that lights the pathway but one step ahead
across a void of mystery and dread
bid , then , the tender light of faith to shine
ABBA
like as the lute delights or else dislikes
as is his art that plays upon the same
so sounds my muse according as she strikes
on my heart strings high tuned unto her fame
ABAB
her touch doth cause the warble of the sound
which here i yield in lamentable wise
a wailing descant on the sweetest ground
whose due reports give honour to her eyes
ABAB
else harsh my style , untunable my muse
hoarse sounds the voice that praiseth not her name
if any pleasing relish here i use
then judge the world her beauty gives the same
ABAB
beholding youth and hope in mockery caught
from life ; and mocking pulses that remain
when the soul 's death of bodily death is fain
honour unknown , and honour known unsought
ABBA
and penury 's sedulous self torturing thought
on gold , whose master therewith buys his bane
and longed for woman longing all in vain
for lonely man with love 's desire distraught
ABBA
and wealth , and strength , and power , and pleasantness
given unto bodies of whose souls men say
none poor and weak , slavish and foul , as they
beholding these things , i behold no less
ABBA
even as upon a low and cloud domed day
when clouds are one cloud till the horizon
our thinking senses deem the sun away
and say «’ tis sunless » and « there is no sun
ABAB
and yet the very day they wrong truth by
is of the unseen sun ’ s effluent essence
the very words do give themselves the lie
the very thought of absence comes from presence
ABAB
even so deem we through good of what is evil
he speaks of light that speaks of absent light
and absent god , becoming present devil
is still the absent god by essence ’ right
ABAB
arise , o master artist of the age
and paint the picture which at once shall be
immortal art and bless 'd prophecy
the bruised vision of the world assuage
ABBA
to earth 's dark book add one illumined page
so scintillant with truth , that all who see
shall break from superstition and stand free
now let this wondrous work thy hand engage
ABBA
light feet , dark violet eyes , and parted hair
soft dimpled hands , white neck , and creamy breast
are things on which the dazzled senses rest
till the fond , fixed eyes , forget they stare
ABBA
from such fine pictures , heavens ! i cannot dare
to turn my admiration , though unpossess 'd
they be of what is worthy ,— though not drest
in lovely modesty , and virtues rare
ABBA
yet these i leave as thoughtless as a lark
these lures i straight forget ,— e'en ere i dine
or thrice my palate moisten : but when i mark
such charms with mild intelligences shine
ABAB
‘ to all and singular , ’ as dryden says
we bring a fancy of those georgian days
whose style still breathed a faint and fine perfume
of old world courtliness and old world bloom
AABB
when speech was elegant and talk was fit
for slang had not been canonised as wit
when manners reigned , when breeding had the wall
and women — yes !— were ladies first of all
AABB
when grace was conscious of its gracefulness
and man — though man !— was not ashamed to dress
a brave formality , a measured ease
were his — and hers — whose effort was to please
AABB
“ as ever on this side the boiling wave
thou seest diminishing , ” the centaur said
“ so on the other , be thou well assur 'd
it lower still and lower sinks its bed
ABAB
yes , fled already is thy vital fire
and the fair promise of thy early bloom
lost , in youth 's morn extinct ; sunk in the tomb
mute in the grave sleeps thy enchanted lyre
ABBA
and is it vainly that our souls aspire
falsely does the presaging heart presume
that we shall live beyond life 's cares and gloom
grasps it eternity with high desire
ABBA
but to imagine bliss , feel woe , and die
leaving survivors to worse pangs than death
not such the sanction of the eternal mind
the harmonious order of the starry sky
ABBA
lord ! when you have enough , what need you care
how merrily soever others fare
though all the day i give and take delight
doubt not , sufficient will be left at night
AABB
‘ tis but a just and rational desire
to light a taper at a neighbour 's fire
there 's danger too , you think , in rich array
and none can long be modest that are gay
AABB
the cat , if you but singe her tabby skin
the chimney keeps , and sits content within
but once grown sleek , will from her corner run
sport with her tail , and wanton in the sun
AABB
but most uncommon seems a lowly cook
who with sincerity can kiss the book
and swear ( to shame her betters !) ne'er she took
by sad “ mistake or otherwise , ” by hook
AABB
what ! you whip rascals ?— you , whose gutter blood
bears , in its dark , dishonorable flood
enough of prison birds ’ prolific germs
to serve a whole eternity of terms
AABB
you , for whose back the rods and cudgels strove
ere yet the ax had hewn them from the grove
you , the de young whose splendor bright and brave
is phosphorescence from another 's grave
AABB
till now unknown , by any chance or luck
even to the hearts at which you , feebly struck
you whip a rascal out of office ?— you
whose leadless weapon once ignobly blew
AABB
see ! how the stubborne damzell doth deprave
my simple meaning with disdaynfull scorne
and by the bay which i unto her gave
accoumpts my self her captive quite forlorne
ABAB
but sith she will the conquest challeng needs
let her accept me as her faithfull thrall
that her great triumph , which my skill exceeds
i may in trump of fame blaze over all
ABAB
the frugal snail , with forecast of repose
carries his house with him where'er he goes
peeps out ,— and if there comes a shower of rain
retreats to his small domicile amain
AABB
touch but a tip of him , a horn ,— ‘ tis well
he curls up in his sanctuary shell
he 's his own landlord , his own tenant ; stay
long as he will , he dreads no quarter day
AABB
himself he boards and lodges ; both invites
and feasts himself ; sleeps with himself o ’ nights
he spares the upholsterer trouble to procure
chattels ; himself is his own furniture
AABB
mysterious night ! when our first parent knew
thee from report divine , and heard thy name
did he not tremble for this lovely frame
this glorious canopy of light and blue
ABBA
yet ‘ neath the curtain of translucent dew
bathed in the rays of the great setting flame
hesperus with the host of heaven came
and lo ! creation widened on man 's view
ABBA
who could have thought such darkness lay concealed
within thy beams , o sun ! or who could find
while fly , and leaf , and insect stood revealed
that to such countless orbs thou mad'st us blind
ABAB
stern diomed with either ajax stood
and great ulysses , bathed in hostile blood
embodied close , the labouring grecian train
the fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain
AABB
unmoved and silent , the whole war they wait
serenely dreadful , and as fix ’ d as fate
so when the embattled clouds in dark array
along the skies their gloomy lines display
AABB
when now the north his boisterous rage has spent
and peaceful sleeps the liquid element
the low hung vapours , motionless and still
rest on the summits of the shaded hill
AABB
you sacred sea nymphs pleasantly disporting
amidst this wat'ry world , where now i sail
if ever love , or lovers sad reporting
had power sweet tears from your fair eyes to hail
ABAB
and you , more gentle hearted than the rest
under the northern noon stead sweetly streaming
lend those moist riches of your crystal crest
to quench the flames from my heart 's æ tna streaming
ABAB
and thou , kind triton , in thy trumpet relish
the ruthful accents of my discontent
that midst this travel desolate and hellish
some gentle wind that listens my lament
ABAB
that time , fair licia , when i stole a kiss
from off those lips , where cupid lovely laid
i quaked for cold , and found the cause was this
my life which loved , for love behind me staid
ABAB
i sent my heart my life for to recall
but that was held , not able to return
and both detained as captives were in thrall
and judged by her , that both by sighs should burn
ABAB
fair , burn them both , for that they were so bold
but let the altar be within thy heart
and i shall live because my life you hold
you that give life , to every living part
ABAB
what hast thou done , o womanhood of france
mother and daughter , sister , sweetheart , wife
what hast thou done , amid this fateful strife
to prove the pride of thine inheritance
ABBA
in this fair land of freedom and romance
i hear thy voice with tears and courage rife
smiling against the swords that seek thy life
make answer in a noble utterance
ABBA
“ i give france all i have , and all she asks
would it were more ! ah , let her ask and take
my hands to nurse her wounded , do her tasks
my feet to run her errands through the dark
ABAB
be wise as thou art cruel , do not press
my tongue tied patience with too much disdain
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pity wanting pain
ABAB
if i might teach thee wit better it were
though not to love , yet love to tell me so
as testy sick men when their deaths be near
no news but health from their physicians know
ABAB
for if i should despair i should grow mad
and in my madness might speak ill of thee
now this ill wresting world is grown so bad
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
ABAB
the everlasting grass — how bright , how cool
the day has gone too suddenly , too soon
there 's something white and shiny in that pool
throw in a stone , and you will hit the moon
ABAB
listen , the church bell ringing ! do not say
we must go back to morrow to our work
we 'll tell them we are dead : we died to day
we 're lazy . we 're too happy . we will shirk
ABAB
we 're cows . we 're kettles . we 'll be anything
except the manikins of time and fear
we 'll start away to morrow wandering
and nobody will notice in a year
ABAB
most happy letters ! fram 'd by skilfull trade
with which that happy name was first desynd
the which three times thrise happy hath me made
with guifts of body , fortune , and of mind
ABAB
the first ray being to me gave by kind
from mothers womb deriv 'd by dew descent
the second is my sovereigne queene most kind
that honour and large richesse to me lent
ABAB
i saw , sweet licia , when the spider ran
within your house to weave a worthless web
you present were and feared her with your fan
so that amaz è d speedily she fled
ABAB
she in your house such sweet perfumes did smell
and heard the muses with their notes refined
thus filled with envy , could no longer dwell
but straight returned and at your house repined
ABAB
if wrongfully i moan 'd thy ‘ pretty wrongs
when i was ‘ sometime absent from thy heart
o none so trusting but to him belongs
some moody moment of his mortal part
ABAB
no man doth nature make whose trust doth ever
unveering with all winds point still the same
none is so whole in health he knows no fever
to shake the firm composure of his frame
ABAB
my love so wholly thine , thy worth so dear
made each thine absence so distract my breast
that in his turmoil faith sometime to fear
converted , doubting most when most ‘ twas blest
ABAB
the young queen nature , ever sweet and fair
once on a time fell upon evil days
from hearing oft herself discussed with praise
there grew within her heart the longing rare
ABBA
to see herself ; and every passing air
the warm desire fanned into lusty blaze
full oft she sought this end by devious ways
but sought in vain , so fell she in despair
ABBA
for none within her train nor by her side
could solve the task or give the envied boon
so day and night , beneath the sun and moon
she wandered to and fro unsatisfied
ABBA
the little love god lying once asleep
laid by his side his heart inflaming brand
whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
came tripping by , but in her maiden hand
ABAB
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warmed
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
ABAB
when our two souls stand up erect and strong
face to face , silent , drawing nigh and nigher
until the lengthening wings break into fire
at either curved point ,— what bitter wrong
ABBA
can the earth do to us , that we should not long
be here contented ? think ! in mounting higher
the angels would press on us and aspire
to drop some golden orb of perfect song
ABBA
into our deep , dear silence . let us stay
rather on earth , beloved ,— where the unfit
contrarious moods of men recoil away
and isolate pure spirits , and permit
ABAB
what ancient times , those times we fancy wise
have left on long record of woman 's rise
what morals teach it , and what fables hide
what author wrote it , how that author died
AABB
all these i sing . in greece they framed the tale
( in greece , ‘ twas thought a woman might be frail
ye modern beauties ! where the poet drew
his softest pencil , think he dreamt of you
AABB
and warn 'd by him , ye wanton pens , beware
how heaven 's concern 'd to vindicate the fair
the case was hesiod 's ; he the fable writ
some think with meaning — some , with idle wit
AABB
live blindly and upon the hour . the lord
who was the future , died full long ago
knowledge which is the past is folly . go
poor child , and be not to thyself abhorred
ABBA
around thine earth sun winged winds do blow
and planets roll ; a meteor draws his sword
the rainbow breaks his seven coloured chord
and the long strips of river silver flow
ABBA
awake ! give thyself to the lovely hours
drinking their lips , catch thou the dream in flight
about their fragile hairs ’ aerial gold
thou art divine , thou livest , — as of old
AABB
again , and through the arras of the gloom
are the pale breezes moaning : by her tomb
bends julio , like a phantom , and his eye
is fallen , as the moon borne tides , that lie
AABB
at ebb within the sea . oh ! he is wan
as winter skies are wan , like ages gone
and stars unseen for paleness ; it is cast
as foliage in the raving of the blast
AABB
all his fair bloom of thoughts ! is the moon chill
that in the dark clouds she is mantled still
and over its proud arch hath heaven flung
a scarf of darkness ? agath è was young
AABB
o ye , who dwell in youth 's inviting bowers
waste not , in useless joy , your fleeting hours
but rather let the tears of sorrow roll
and sad reflection fill the conscious soul
AABB
for many a jocund spring has passed away
and many a flower has blossomed , to decay
and human life , still hastening to a close
finds in the worthless dust its last repose
AABB
still the vain world abounds in strife and hate
and sire and son provoke each other 's fate
and kindred blood by kindred hands is shed
and vengeance sleeps not — dies not , with the dead
AABB
such age , how beautiful ! o lady bright
whose mortal lineaments seem all refined
by favouring nature and a saintly mind
to something purer and more exquisite
ABBA
than flesh and blood ; whene'er thou meet'est my sight
when i behold thy blanched unwithered cheek
thy temples fringed with locks of gleaming white
and head that droops because the soul is meek
ABAB
thee with the welcome snowdrop i compare
that child of winter , prompting thoughts that climb
from desolation toward the genial prime
or with the moon conquering earth 's misty air
ABBA
viii . if thou didst pass by art , thou didst not scorn
the souls that by such symbol yearned in vain
from truth and love true nourishment to gain
on thy warm breast , so chilly and forlorn
ABBA
fell these thy nurslings little more than born
that thou wast anguished , and there fell a rain
from thy blest eyelids , and in grief and pain
thou partedst from them yet one night and morn
ABBA
to find them wholesome food and nourishment
instead of what their blindness took for such
laying thyself a seed in earthen rent
from which , outspringing to the willing touch
ABAB
oh , had we room to rip the mighty bags
that time , the harlequin , has stuffed with rags
grant us one moment to unloose the strings
while the old graybeard shuts his leather wings
AABB
but what a heap of motley trash appears
crammed in the bundles of successive years
as the lost rustic on some festal day
stares through the concourse in its vast array
AABB
where in one cake a throng of faces runs
all stuck together like a sheet of buns
and throws the bait of some unheeded name
or shoots a wink with most uncertain aim
AABB
gazing he spoke , and , kindling at the view
his eager arms around the goddess threw
glad earth perceives , and from her bosom pours
unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers
AABB
thick new born violets a soft carpet spread
and clustering lotos swell ’ d the rising bed
and sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow
and flamy crocus made the mountain glow
AABB
there golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair
steep ’ d in soft joys and circumfused with air
celestial dews , descending o ’ er the ground
perfume the mount , and breathe ambrosia round
AABB
most men know love but as a part of life
they hide it in some corner of the breast
even from themselves ; and only when they rest
in the brief pauses of that daily strife
ABBA
wherewith the world might else be not so rife
they draw it forth ( as one draws forth a toy
to soothe some ardent , kiss exacting boy
and hold it up to sister , child , or wife
ABBA
ah me ! why may not love and life be one
why walk we thus alone , when by our side
love , like a visible god , might be our guide
how would the marts grow noble ! and the street
ABBA
i , strengthened , left him . next in a close place
mid houses crowded , dingy , barred , and high
where men live not except to sell and buy
to me , leaving a doorway , came a grace
ABBA
( surely from heaven she came , though all that race
walketh on human feet beneath the sky
i , going on , beheld not who was nigh
when a sweet girl looked up into my face
ABBA
with earnest eyes , most maidenly sedate
looked up to me , as i to him did look
‘ twas much to me whom sometimes men mistook
she asked me where we dwelt , that she might wait
ABBA
i had forgotten what i had lightly said
and without speech , without a thought i went
steeped in that golden quiet , all content
to drink the transient beauty as it sped
ABBA
out of eternal darkness into time
to light and burn and know itself a fire
yet doomed — ah , fate of the fulfilled desire
to fade , a meteor , paying for the crime
ABBA
of living glorious in the denser air
of our material earth . a strange despair
an agony , yet strangely , subtly sweet
and tender as an unpassionate caress
AABB
the spring returns ! what matters then that war
on the horizon like a beacon burns
that death ascends , man 's most desired star
that darkness is his hope ? the spring returns
ABAB
the beggar garbed or over bent with snows
each mortal , long defeated , disallowed
feeling her touch , grows stronger limbed , and knows
the purple on his shoulders and is proud
ABAB
where slanting banks are always with the sun
the daisy is in blossom even now
and where warm patches by the hedges run
the cottager when coming home from plough
ABAB
brings home a cowslip root in flower to set
thus ere the christmas goes the spring is met
setting up little tents about the fields
in sheltered spots .— primroses when they get
AABB
a lofty type of all her sex , i ween
my english brothers , though your wayward race
now slight the soul that never wore a screen
and loved too well to keep her noble place
ABAB
ah , bravest woman that our world hath seen
( a light in spaces wild and tempest tost
in every verse of thine , behold , we trace
the full reflection of an earnest face
AABB
and hear the scrawling of an eager pen
o sisters ! knowing what you 've loved and lost
i ask where shall we find its like , and when
that dear heart with its passion sorrow crost
ABAB
till all have ceased for ever , and the sum
be summed of all the sumless curses told
out on his head by all dark seasons rolled
over its cursed and crowned existence , dumb
ABBA
and blind and stark as though the snows made numb
all sense within it , and all conscience cold
that hangs round hearts of less imperial mould
like a snake feeding till their doomsday come
ABBA
o heart fast bound of frozen poison , be
all nature 's as all true men 's hearts to thee
a two edged sword of judgment ; hope be far
and fear at hand for pilot oversea
AABB
“ yon cottager , who weaves at her own door
pillow and bobbins all her little store
content though mean , and cheerful if not gay
shuffling her threads about the live long day
AABB
just earns a scanty pittance , and at night
lies down secure , her heart and pocket light
she , for her humble sphere by nature fit
has little understanding , and no wit
AABB
receives no praise ; but , though her lot be such
( toilsome and indigent ) she renders much
just knows , and knows no more , her bible true
a truth the brilliant frenchman never knew
AABB
if ever any justly might complain
of unrequited service , it is i
change is the thanks i have for loyalty
and only her reward is her disdain
ABBA
so as just spite did almost me constrain
through torment her due praises to deny
for he which vex è d is with injury
by speaking ill doth ease his heart of pain
ABBA
but what , shall torture make me wrong her name
no , no , a pris'ner constant thinks it shame
though he ( were ) racked his first truth to gainsay
her true given praise my first confession is
AABB
if , aged charon , when my life shall end
i pass thy ferry and my waftage pay
thy oars shall fall , thy boat and mast shall rend
and through the deep shall be a dry foot way
ABAB
for why ? my heart with sighs doth breathe such flame
that air and water both incens è d be
the boundless ocean from whose mouth they came
for from my heat not heaven itself is free
ABAB
then since to me thy loss can be no gain
avoid thy harm and fly what i foretell
make thou thy love with me for to be slain
that i with her and both with thee may dwell
ABAB
sweet sovereign , since so many minds remain
obedient subjects at thy beauty 's call
so many hearts bound in thy hairs as thrall
so many eyes die with one look 's disdain
ABBA
go , seek the honour that doth thee pertain
that the fifth monarchy may thee befall
thou hast such means to conquer men withal
as all the world must yield or else be slain
ABBA
ingratitude , how deadly is thy smart
proceeding from the form we fondly love
how light , compared , all other sorrows prove
thou shed'st a night of woe , from whence depart
ABBA
the gentle beams of patience , that the heart
‘ mid lesser ills , illume .— thy victims rove
unquiet as the ghost that haunts the grove
where murder spilt the life blood .— o ! thy dart
ABBA
kills more than life ,— e'en all that makes life dear
till we “ the sensible of pain ” wou 'd change
for phrenzy , that defies the bitter tear
or wish , in kindred callousness , to range
ABAB
time , the old humourist , has a trick to day
of moving landmarks and of levelling down
till into town the suburbs edge their way
and in the suburbs you may scent the town
ABAB
with mount st. thus approaching muswell hill
and clapham common marching with the mile
you get a hammersmith that fills the bill
a hampstead with a serious sense of style
ABAB
so this fair creature , pictured in the row
as one of that ‘ gay adulterous world , ’ { 79 } whose round
is by the serpentine , as well would show
and might , i deem , as readily be found
ABAB
the first created held a joyous bower
a flowering field , the world 's sole wonderment
high paradise , from whence a woman 's power
enticed him to fall to endless banishment
ABAB
this on the banks of euphrates did stand
till the first mover , by his wondrous might
planted it in thine eyes , thy face , thy hands
from whence the world receives his fairest light
ABAB
thy cheeks contain choice flowers ; thy eyes , two suns
thy hands , the fruit that no life blood can stain
and in thy breath , that heavenly music wons
which , when thou speak'st , angels their voices strain
ABAB
keep love for youth , and violets for the spring
of if these bloom when worn out autumn grieves
let them lie hid in double shade of leaves
their own , and others dropped down withering
ABBA
for violets suit when home birds build and sing
not when the outbound bird a passage cleaves
not with dry stubble of mown harvest sheaves
but when the green world buds to blossoming
ABBA
keep violets for the spring , and love for youth
love that should dwell with beauty , mirth , and hope
or if a later sadder love be born
let this not look for grace beyond its scope
ABAB
and again he pointed across the sea
and another vision arose in me
and i knew i walked an ocean of fear
yet of safety too , for the master was near
AABB
and every wave of sorrow or dread
o'er which strong faith should upraise my head
would show from the height of its troubled crest
still nearer and nearer the land of rest
AABB
and when the storm spray on the wind should arise
and with tears unbidden should blind mine eyes
and hide from my vision the home of love
i knew i must look to the star above
AABB
and so the empty handed years went round
vacant , though voiceful with prophetic sound
and so , that summer morn , he sat and mused
with folded , patient hands , as he was used
AABB
and dreamily before his half closed sight
floated the vision of his lost delight
beside him , motionless , the drowsy bird
dreamed of the chase , and in his slumber heard
AABB
the sudden , scythe like sweep of wings , that dare
the headlong plunge thro ’ eddying gulfs of air
then , starting broad awake upon his perch
tinkled his bells , like mass bells in a church
AABB
whenas i wish , fair licia , for a kiss
from those sweet lips where rose and lilies strive
straight do mine eyes repine at such a bliss
and seek my lips thereof for to deprive
ABAB
whenas i seek to glut mine eyes by sight
my lips repine and call mine eyes away
thus both contend to have each other 's right
and both conspire to work my full decay
ABAB
o force admired of beauty in her pride
in whose each part such strange effects there be
that all my forces in themselves divide
and make my senses plainly disagree
ABAB
“ whatever spirit , careless of his charge
his post neglects , or leaves the fair at large
shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins
be stopped in vials , or transfixed with pins
AABB
or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie
or wedged whole ages in a bodkin 's eye
gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain
while clogged he beats his silken wings in vain
AABB
or alum styptics with contracting power
shrink his thin essence like a rivelled flower
or , as ixion fixed , the wretch shall feel
the giddy motion of the whirling mill
AABB
long have i loved the beauty of thy streets
fair dublin : long , with unavailing vows
sigh 'd to all guardian deities who rouse
the spirits of dead nations to new heats
ABBA
genius alone brings back the days of yore
look ! look , what life is in these quaint old shops
the loneliest lanes are rattling with the roar
of coach and chair ; fans , feathers , flambeaus , fops
ABAB
there 's never a delicate nurseling of the year
but our huge london hails it , and delights
to wear it on her breast or at her ear
her days to colour and make sweet her nights
ABAB
crocus and daffodil and violet
pink , primrose , valley lily , clove carnation
red rose and white rose , wall flower , mignonette
the daisies all — these be her recreation
ABAB
her gaudies these ! and forth from drury lane
trapesing in any of her whirl of weathers
her flower girls foot it , honest and hoarse and vain
all boot and little shawl and wilted feathers
ABAB
resolved to love , unworthy to obtain
i do no favour crave ; but , humble wise
to thee my sighs in verse i sacrifice
only some pity and no help to gain
ABBA
hear then , and as my heart shall aye remain
a patient object to thy lightning eyes
a patient ear bring thou to thund'ring cries
fear not the crack , when i the blow sustain
ABBA
so as thine eye bred mine ambitious thought
so shall thine ear make proud my voice for joy
lo , dear , what wonders great by thee are wrought
when i but little favour do enjoy
ABAB
dan cupid , though the god of soft amour
in ev'ry age works miracles a store
can catos change to male coquets at ease
and fools make oracles whene'er he please
AABB
turn wolves to sheep , and ev'ry thing so well
that naught remains the former shape to tell
remember , hercules , with wond'rous pow'r
and polyphemus , who would men devour
AABB
the one upon a rock himself would fling
and to the winds his am'rous ditties sing
to cut his beard a nymph could him inspire
and , in the water , he 'd his face admire
AABB
if tired of trees i seek again mankind
well i know where to hie me — in the dawn
to a slope where the cattle keep the lawn
there amid lolling juniper reclined
ABBA
myself unseen , i see in white defined
far off the homes of men , and farther still
the graves of men on an opposing hill
living or dead , whichever are to mind
ABBA
and if by moon i have too much of these
i have but to turn on my arm , and lo
the sun burned hillside sets my face aglow
my breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze
ABBA
so , when all shrouded were in silent night
the galles were , by corrupting of a mayde
possest nigh of the capitol through slight
had not a goose the treachery bewrayde
ABAB
if then a goose great rome from ruine stayde
and iove himselfe , the patron of the place
preservd from being to his foes betrayde
why do vaine men mean things so much deface
ABAB
when love puffed up with rage of high disdain
resolved to make me pattern of his might
like foe , whose wits inclined to deadly spite
would often kill , to breed more feeling pain
ABBA
he would not , armed with beauty , only reign
on those affects which easily yield to sight
but virtue sets so high , that reason 's light
for all his strife can only bondage gain
ABBA
so that i live to pay a mortal fee
dead palsy sick of all my chiefest parts
like those whom dreams make ugly monsters see
and can cry help with naught but groans and starts
ABAB
and speaking thus , he leapt on black lewin
and smote him twice full hard upon the chin
two goodly blows upon that big , black jowl
whereat black lewin lustily did howl
AABB
and falling back , his polished bascinet
with ringing clash the cold , hard flagstones met
whereat his fellows , shouting fierce alarms
incontinent betook them to their arms
AABB
and thus it seemed a fight there must have been
but that a horseman sudden spurred between
a blue eyed youth with yellow , curling hair
of slender shape , of face and feature fair
AABB
can it be right to give what i can give
to let thee sit beneath the fall of tears
as salt as mine , and hear the sighing years
re sighing on my lips renunciative
ABBA
through those infrequent smiles which fail to live
for all thy adjurations ? o my fears
that this can scarce be right ! we are not peers
so to be lovers ; and i own , and grieve
ABBA
that givers of such gifts as mine are , must
be counted with the ungenerous . out , alas
i will not soil thy purple with my dust
nor breathe my poison on thy venice glass
ABAB
if thy soul check thee that i come so near
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy ‘ will
and will thy soul knows is admitted there
thus far for love , my love suit sweet fulfil
ABAB
‘ will ’ , will fulfil the treasure of thy love
ay , fill it full with wills , and my will one
in things of great receipt with case we prove
among a number one is reckoned none
ABAB
then in the number let me pass untold
though in thy store 's account i one must be
for nothing hold me , so it please thee hold
that nothing me , a something sweet to thee
ABAB
thou first , great ajax ! on the unsanguined plain
laid hyrtius , leader of the mysian train
phalces and mermer , nestor ’ s son o ’ erthrew
bold merion , morys and hippotion slew
AABB
strong periphaetes and prothoon bled
by teucer ’ s arrows mingled with the dead
pierced in the flank by menelaus ’ steel
his people ’ s pastor , hyperenor fell
AABB
eternal darkness wrapp ’ d the warrior round
and the fierce soul came rushing through the wound
but stretch ’ d in heaps before oileus ’ son
fall mighty numbers , mighty numbers run
AABB
what tyranny is this , both my hart to thrall
and eke my toung with proud restraint to tie
that neither i may speake nor thinke at all
but like a stupid stock in silence die
ABAB
now hearkening thus , they both became aware
of distant bells that throbbed upon the air
a faint , insistent sound that rose and fell
a clamour vague that ominous did swell
AABB
as thus they stood , well hidden from the road
footsteps they heard of feet that briskly strode
and , through the leaves , a small man they espied
who came apace , a great sword by his side
AABB
large bascinet upon his head he bore
‘ neath which his face a scowl portentous wore
while after toiled a stout but reverend friar
who , scant of breath , profusely did perspire
AABB
the powre thereof , which ofte in me i find
let it likewise your gentle brest inspire
with sweet infusion , and put you in mind
of that proud mayd whom now those leaves attyre
ABAB
while loftier souls command , nay , make their fate
thy fate made thee and forced thee to be great
yet fortune , who so oft , so blindly sheds
her brightest halo round the weakest heads
AABB
found thee undazzled , tranquil as before
proud to be useful , scorning to be more
less moved by glory 's than by duty 's claim
renown the meed , but self applause the aim
AABB
all that thou wert reflects less fame on thee
far less , than all thou didst forbear to be
nor yet the patriot of one land alone
for , thine 's a name all nations claim their own
AABB
long having deeply gron 'd these visions sad
i saw a citie like unto that same
which saw the messenger of tidings glad
but that on sand was built the goodly frame
ABAB
it seem 'd her top the firmament did rayse
and , no lesse rich than faire , right worthie sure
( if ought here worthie ) of immortall dayes
or if ought under heaven might firme endure
ABAB
much wondred i to see so faire a wall
when from the northerns coast a storme arose
which , breathing furie from his inward gall
on all which did against his course oppose
ABAB
away they went , and gyges much admired
still more than that : in truth his breast was fired
for when she moved astonishment was great
and ev'ry grace upon her seemed to wait
AABB
emotion to suppress howe'er he tried
since he had promised what he felt to hide
to hold his tongue he wished , but that might raise
suspicions of designs and mystick ways
AABB
exaggeration was the better part
and from the subject he would never start
but fully praised each beauty in detail
without appearing any thing to veil
AABB
with oute gilt , but thy benignitee
upon my dedly herte have som pitee
for wel i woot , lord phebus , if yow lest
ye may me helpen , save my lady , best
AABB
for if we grant him dead , it is as true
against our selves , no wit , no poet now
or if he be returnd from his coole shade
to us , this booke his resurrection 's made
AABB
we bleed our selves to death , and but contrive
by our owne epitaphs to shew him alive
but let him live and let me prophesie
as i goe swan like out , our peace is nigh
AABB
then hate me when thou wilt , if ever , now
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune , make me bow
and do not drop in for an after loss
ABAB
ah do not , when my heart hath ‘ scaped this sorrow
come in the rearward of a conquered woe
give not a windy night a rainy morrow
to linger out a purposed overthrow
ABAB
if thou wilt leave me , do not leave me last
when other petty griefs have done their spite
but in the onset come , so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortune 's might
ABAB
death to my life , life to my long despair
prolonged by her , given to my love and days
are means to tell how truly she is fair
and i can die to testify her praise
ABAB
degenerate douglas ! oh , the unworthy lord
whom mere despite of heart could so far please
and love of havoc ( for with such disease
fame taxes him ) that he could send forth word
ABBA
to level with the dust a noble horde
a brotherhood of venerable trees
leaving an ancient dome , and towers like these
beggared and outraged !— many hearts deplor 'd
ABBA
the fate of those old trees ; and oft with pain
the traveller , at this day , will stop and gaze
on wrongs , which nature scarcely seems to heed
for shelter 'd places , bosoms , nooks and bays
ABAB
day 's golden eye had closed , his ruddy light
expiring on the bosom of the night
and solitary twilight 's deepening shade
in dusky robe the firmament array 'd
AABB
the moon , resplendent , fill 'd her glittering throne
and tipp 'd with yellow gems all ether shone
the breeze was silent on the glassy deep
and half the world was sinking into sleep
AABB
save where the shepherd led his fleecy train
to crop the verdure of the moon light plain
save where the warder on the turret 's height
trimm 'd his weak lamp , and watch 'd the bell of night
AABB
when pandarus beheld his brother kill 'd
the town with fear and wild confusion fill 'd
he turns the hinges of the heavy gate
with both his hands , and adds his shoulders to the weight
AABB
he thrust amid the crowd , securely bold
like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold
too late his blazing buckler they descry
and sparkling fires that shot from either eye
AABB
over the threshold of his pleasant home
set in green clearings passed the exiled friend
in simple trust , misdoubting not the end
“ dear heart of mine ! ” he said , “ the time has come
ABBA
to trust the lord for shelter . ” one long gaze
the goodwife turned on each familiar thing
the lowing kine , the orchard blossoming
the open door that showed the hearth fire 's blaze
ABBA
and calmly answered , “ yes , he will provide
silent and slow they crossed the homestead 's bound
lingering the longest by their child 's grave mound
“ move on , or stay and hang ! ” the sheriff cried
ABBA
chained by stern duty to the rock of state
his spirit armed in mail of rugged mirth
ever above , though ever near to earth
yet felt his heart the cruel tongues that sate
ABBA
base appetites and , foul with slander , wait
till the keen lightnings bring the awful hour
when wounds and suffering shall give them power
most was he like to luther , gay and great
ABBA
solemn and mirthful , strong of heart and limb
tender and simple , too ; he was so near
to all things human that he cast out fear
and , ever simpler , like a little child
ABBA
falsely doth envy of your praises blame
my tongue , my pen , my heart of flattery
because i said there was no sun but thee
it called my tongue the partial trump of fame
ABBA
and saith my pen hath flatter è d thy name
because my pen did to my tongue agree
and that my heart must needs a flatterer be
which taught both tongue and pen to say the same
ABBA
no , no , i flatter not when thee i call
the sun , sith that the sun was never such
but when the sun thee i compared withal
doubtless the sun i flatter è d too much
ABAB
milton ! thou shouldst be living at this hour
england hath need of thee ; she is a fen
of stagnant waters ; altar , sword , and pen
fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower
ABBA
have forfeited their ancient english dower
of inward happiness . we are selfish men
oh ! raise us up , return to us again
and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power
ABBA
thy soul was like a star , and dwelt apart
thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea
pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free
so didst thou travel on life 's common way
ABBA
here is the place where loveliness keeps house
between the river and the wooded hills
within a valley where the springtime spills
her firstling wind flowers under blossoming boughs
ABBA
where summer sits braiding her warm , white brows
with bramble roses ; and where autumn fills
her lap with asters ; and old winter frills
with crimson haw and hip his snowy blouse
ABBA
if heaven a date of many years would give
thus i 'd in pleasure , ease , and plenty live
and as i near approach [ ed ] the verge of life
some kind relation ( for i 'd have no wife
AABB
should take upon him all my worldly care
while i did for a better state prepare
then i 'd not be with any trouble vexed
nor have the evening of my days perplexed
AABB
but by a silent and a peaceful death
without a sigh , resign my aged breath
and , when committed to the dust , i 'd have
few tears , but friendly , dropped into my grave
AABB
well , i felt for the lady , and felt for my hat too
improvised on the crown of the latter a tattoo
in lieu of expressing the feelings which lay
quite too deep for words , as wordsworth would say
AABB
then , without going through the form of a bow
found myself in the entry ,— i hardly knew how
on doorstep and sidewalk , past lamp post and square
at home and up stairs , in my own easy chair
AABB
poked my feet into slippers , my fire into blaze
and said to myself , as i lit my cigar
supposing a man had the wealth of the czar
of the russias to boot , for the rest of his days
ABBA
here , where peralta 's cattle used to stray
here , where the spaniards in their early day
rode , jingling , booted , spurred , nor ever guessed
our race would own the land by them possessed
AABB
here , where castilian bull fights left their stain
of blood upon the soil of this new spain
here , where old live oaks , spared till we condemn
still wait within this city named for them
AABB
we celebrate , with bombshell and with rhyme
our noisiest day of days of yearly time
o bare antonio 's hills that rim our sky
antonio 's hills , that used to know july
AABB
“ is this ( returns the prince ) for mirth a time
when lawless gluttons riot , mirth 's a crime
the luscious wines , dishonour 'd , lose their taste
the song is noise , and impious is the feast
AABB
suffice it to have spent with swift decay
the wealth of kings , and made my youth a prey
but now the wise instructions of the sage
and manly thoughts inspired by manly age
AABB
teach me to seek redress for all my woe
here , or in pyle — in pyle , or here , your foe
deny your vessels , ye deny in vain
a private voyager i pass the main
AABB
methought that in a solemn church i stood
its marble acres , worn with knees and feet
lay spread from door to door , from street to street
midway the form hung high upon the rood
ABBA
of him who gave his life to be our good
beyond , priests flitted , bowed , and murmured meet
among the candles , shining still and sweet
men came and went , and worshipped as they could
ABBA
and still their dust a woman with her broom
bowed to her work , kept sweeping to the door
then saw i , slow through all the pillared gloom
across the church a silent figure come
ABAB
tell me , my muse , my goddess from above
of dazzling sheen , and clothed in robes of love
what this wild rage — this cataclysmic fall
what rends the welkin , and , who rules them all
AABB
“ ‘ tis god ! the blest ! all elements are his
who rules the unfathonable dark abyss
‘ tis god commands ! his edicts are their will
be silent , heavens ! the heavens are hushed and still
AABB
these are the wail of elemental life
the fire and water wage supernal strife
the blasting fire , with scathing , angry glare
gleamed like an asphalte furnace in the air
AABB
at length i have thee ! my brisk new comer
sounding thy lay to departing summer
and i 'll take thee up from thy bed of grass
and carry thee home to a house of glass
AABB
where thy slender limbs , and the faded green
of thy close made coat , can all be seen
for i long to know if the cricket sings
or plays the tune with his gauzy wings
AABB
to bring that shrill toned pipe to light
which kept me awake so long last night
that i told the hours by the lazy clock
till i heard the crow of the noisy cock
AABB
i do compare unto thy youthly clear
which always bides within thy flow'ring prime
the month of april , that bedews our clime
with pleasant flowers , when as his showers appear
ABBA
before thy face shall fly false cruelty
before his face the doly season fleets
mild been his looks , thine eyes are full of sweets
firm is his course , firm is thy loyalty
ABBA
he paints the fields through liquid crystal showers
thou paint'st my verse with pallas , learn è d flowers
with zephirus ’ sweet , breath he fills the plains
and thou my heart with weeping sighs dost wring
AABB
let woman fear to teach and bear to learn
remembering the first woman 's first mistake
eve had for pupil the inquiring snake
whose doubts she answered on a great concern
ABBA
but he the tables so contrived to turn
it next was his to give and hers to take
till man deemed poison sweet for her sweet sake
and fired a train by which the world must burn
ABBA
did adam love his eve from first to last
i think so ; as we love who works us ill
and wounds us to the quick , yet loves us still
love pardons the unpardonable past
ABBA
once more britannia sheathes her conqu'ring sword
and peace returns , by victory restored
peace , that erewhile estranged , ‘ midst long alarms
scarce welcomed home , was ravish 'd from our arms
AABB
what time , fierce bounding from his broken chain
gaul 's banish 'd despot re aspired to reign
whilst at his call , prompt minions of his breath
round his dire throne rush 'd havoc , spoil , and death
AABB
with wonted pomp his baleful ensign blazed
and europe shrunk , and shudder 'd as she gazed
insulted liberty her tocsin rung
again britannia to the combat sprung
AABB
full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
ABAB
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
ABAB
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendour on my brow
but out , alack ! he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath mask 'd him from me now
ABAB
“ fair isle , that from the fairest of all flowers
thy gentlest of all gentle names doth take
how many memories of fierce seismic powers
at sight of thee , as now thou art , awake
ABAB
how many scenes of what departed bliss
how many thoughts of what entombed hopes
did falb foresee such ruinous wreck as this
no more sits peace upon thy verdant slopes
ABAB
subscriptions ! ah , that magical sweet sound
appeals to all , or should appeal . more ! more
suffering demands still more ! charity 's ground
punch now must hold thy flower enamelled shore
ABAB
a hundred instances the fact attest
but sage boccace has one , it is confessed
which seems to me , howe'er we search around
to be a sample , rarely to be found
AABB
‘ tis chimon that i mean , a savage youth
well formed in person , but the rest uncouth
a bear in mind , but cupid much can do
love licked the cub , and decent soon he grew
AABB
a fine gallant at length the lad appeared
from whence the change ?— fine eyes his bosom cheered
the piercing rays no sooner reached his sight
but all the savage took at once to flight
AABB
“ i do beseech thee , god , show me thy face
“ come up to me in sinai on the morn
thou shalt behold as much as may be borne
and moses on a rock stood lone in space
ABBA
from sinai 's top , the vaporous , thunderous place
god passed in clouds , an earthly garment worn
to hide , and thus reveal . in love , not scorn
he put him in a cleft in the rock 's base
ABBA
covered him with his hand , his eyes to screen
then passed , and showed his back through mists of years
ah , moses ! had he turned , and hadst thou seen
the pale face crowned with thorns , baptized with tears
ABAB
one place there is — beneath the burial sod
where all mankind are equalized by death
another place there is — the fane of god
where all are equal , who draw living breath
ABAB
juggle who will elsewhere with his own soul
playing the judas with a temporal dole
he who can come beneath that awful cope
in the dread presence of a maker just
AABB
methought his royal person did foretell
a kingly stateliness , from all pride clear
his look majestic seem è d to compel
all men to love him , rather than to fear
ABAB
and yet though he were every good man 's joy
and the alonely comfort of his own
his very name with terror did annoy
his foreign foes so far as he was known
ABAB
hell drooped for fear ; the turkey moon looked pale
spain trembled ; and the most tempestuous sea
( where behemoth , the babylonish whale
keeps all his bloody and imperious plea
ABAB
up at his attic sill the south wind came
and days of sun and storm but never peace
along the town 's tumultuous arteries
he heard the heart throbs of a sentient frame
ABBA
each night the whistles in the bay , the same
whirl of incessant wheels and clanging cars
for smoke that half obscured , the circling stars
burnt like his youth with but a sickly flame
ABBA
up to his attic came the city cries
the throes with which her iron sinews heave
and yet forever behind prison doors
welled in his heart and trembled in his eyes
ABBA
but on his heavy heart such sadness sate
as if they there transferred that iron weight
no words are uttered — at her sign , a door
reveals the secret passage to the shore
AABB
the city lies behind — they speed , they reach
the glad waves dancing on the yellow beach
and conrad following , at her beck , obeyed
nor cared he now if rescued or betrayed
AABB
safer with winds and waves than human wrath
with ravening wolves than those whose zeal for god
was cruelty to man , the exiles trod
drear leagues of forest without guide or path
ABBA
or launching frail boats on the uncharted sea
round storm vexed capes , whose teeth of granite ground
the waves to foam , their perilous way they wound
enduring all things so their souls were free
ABBA
oh , true confessors , shaming them who did
anew the wrong their pilgrim fathers bore
for you the mayflower spread her sail once more
freighted with souls , to all that duty bid
ABBA
i sing the pilgrim of a softer clime
and milder speech than those brave men 's who brought
to the ice and iron of our winter time
a will as firm , a creed as stern , and wrought
ABAB
with one mailed hand , and with the other fought
simply , as fits my theme , in homely rhyme
i sing the blue eyed german spener taught
through whose veiled , mystic faith the inward light
ABAB
steady and still , an easy brightness , shone
transfiguring all things in its radiance white
the garland which his meekness never sought
i bring him ; over fields of harvest sown
ABBA
young pleasures sporting in luxurious ease
and infant cupid 's on his amour seize
some dragg 'd the bloody cuirass o'er the ground
305 or from his thigh , the pond'rous blade unbound
AABB
some from the casque the crystal torrent pour 'd
to wash the crimson spot that stain 'd the sword
and laugh as in their feeble hand they wield
the crown 's support , the terror of the field
AABB
310 discord , who view 'd him with insulting spite
in savage accents utter 'd fierce delight
rous 'd up the league , the happy moment prest
reviv 'd her serpents drooping in her breast
AABB
the insect world , now sunbeams higher climb
oft dream of spring , and wake before their time
bees stroke their little legs across their wings
and venture short flights where the snow drop hings
AABB
its silver bell , and winter aconite
its buttercup like flowers that shut at night
with green leaf furling round its cup of gold
like tender maiden muffled from the cold
AABB
they sip and find their honey dreams are vain
then feebly hasten to their hives again
the butterflies , by eager hopes undone
glad as a child come out to greet the sun
AABB
my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still
while comments of your praise richly compiled
reserve their character with golden quill
and precious phrase by all the muses filed
ABAB
i think good thoughts , whilst other write good words
and like unlettered clerk still cry amen
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polished form of well refined pen
ABAB
hearing you praised , i say ‘ tis so , ‘ tis true
and to the most of praise add something more
but that is in my thought , whose love to you
( though words come hindmost ) holds his rank before
ABAB
‘ whatever spirit , careless of his charge
his post neglects , or leaves the fair at large
shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins
be stopped in vials , or transfixed with pins
AABB
or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie
or wedged whole ages in a bodkin 's eye
gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain
while clogged he beats his silken wings in vain
AABB
or alum styptics with contracting power
shrink his thin essence like a rivelled flower
or , as ixion fixed , the wretch shall feel
the giddy motion of the whirling mill
AABB
a shady nook where nought is overheard
but wind among the eucalyptus leaves
the cheery chirp of interflitting bird
or wooden squeak of tree frog as it grieves
ABAB
the resting eye broods o'er the running grass
or nodding gestures of the bowed wild oats
watches the oleander lancers pass
and the bright flashing of the oriole notes
ABAB
hushed are the senses with the drone of bees
and the far glimmer of the mid day heat
dreams stealing o'er one like the incoming seas
soft as the rustling zephyrs in the wheat
ABAB
when those renoumed noble peres of greece
through stubborn pride among themselves did iar
forgetfull of the famous golden fleece
then orpheus with his harp theyr strife did bar
ABAB
but when in hand my tunelesse harp i take
then doe i more augment my foes despight
and griefe renew , and passions doe awake
to battaile , fresh against my selfe to fight
ABAB
but thus it is . two songs have men and maidens
one is for hey day , one is sorrow 's cadence
our voices vary with the changing seasons
of life 's long year , for deep and natural reasons
AABB
therefore despair not . think not you have altered
if , at some time , the gayer note has faltered
we are as god has made us . gladness , pain
delight and death , and moods of bliss or bane
AABB
with love and hate , or good and evil — all
at separate times , in separate accents call
yet ‘ t is the same heart throb within the breast
that gives an impulse to our worst and best
AABB
is it her nature , or is it her will
to be so cruell to an humbled foe
if nature , then she may it mend with skill
if will , then she at will may will forgoe
ABAB
but if her nature and her will be so
that she will plague the man that loves her most
and take delight t'encrease a wretches woe
then all her natures goodly guifts are lost
ABAB
when thus fresh meat they have obtain 'd with glee
the largest beasts the hunters bear to me
from which we separate and cast aside
whatever beast by frontal wound has died
AABB
to those the preference we at once decree
in whose left side the fatal mark we see
those to be offer 'd to our fathers ’ manes
within their high and consecrated fanes
AABB
to dry and cure in wooden trays are laid
till bak 'd or roast the offering is made
our guests they dine on the rejected prey
and what they leave is safely stor 'd away
AABB
fair amaryllis , wilt thou never peep
from forth the cave , and call me , and be mine
lo , apples ten i bear thee from the steep
these didst thou long for , and all these are thine
ABAB
ah , would i were a honey bee to sweep
through ivy , and the bracken , and woodbine
to watch thee waken , love , and watch thee sleep
within thy grot below the shadowy pine
ABAB
now know i love , a cruel god is he
the wild beast bare him in the wild wood drear
and truly to the bone he burneth me
but , black browed amaryllis , ne'er a tear
ABAB
herein lives wisdom , beauty , and increase
without this folly , age , and cold decay
if all were minded so , the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
ABAB
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh , featureless , and rude , barrenly perish
look whom she best endowed , she gave thee more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
ABAB
here cocks heroic burn with rival rage
and quails with quails in doubtful fight engage
of armed heels and bristling plumage proud
they sound the insulting clarion shrill and loud
AABB
with rustling pinions meet , and swelling chests
and seize with closing beaks their bleeding crests
rise on quick wing above the struggling foe
and aim in air the death devoting blow
AABB
there the hoarse stag his croaking rival scorns
and butts and parries with his branching horns
contending boars with tusk enamell 'd strike
and guard with shoulder shield the blow oblique
AABB
judge not too idly that our toils are mean
though no new levies marshal on our green
nor deem too rashly that our gains are small
weighed with the prizes for which heroes fall
AABB
see , where thick vapor wreathes the battle line
there mercy follows with her oil and wine
or where brown labor with its peaceful charm
stiffens the sinews of the nation 's arm
AABB
what nerves its hands to strike a deadlier blow
and hurl its legions on the rebel foe
lo ! for each town new rising o'er our state
see the foe 's hamlet waste and desolate
AABB
but to pursue my tale : to welcome home
his warlike brother is pirithous come
arcite of thebes was known in arms long since
and honoured by this young thessalian prince
AABB
theseus , to gratify his friend and guest
who made our arcite 's freedom his request
restored to liberty the captive knight
but on these hard conditions i recite
AABB
that if hereafter arcite should be found
within the compass of athenian ground
by day or night , or on whate'er pretence
his head should pay the forfeit of the offence
AABB
without delay they to the convent flew
but when the holy mansion came in view
respect , the place of execution changed
a citizen his barn for this arranged
AABB
the crafty crew together were confined
and in the blaze their wretched lives resigned
while round the husbands danced at sound of drum
and burnt whatever to their hands had come
AABB
naught ‘ scaped their fury , monks of all degrees
robes , mantles , capuchins , and mock decrees
all perished properly within the flames
but nothing more i find about the dames
AABB
by red ripe mouth and brown , luxurious eyes
of her i love , by all your sweetness shed
in far , fair days , on one whose memory flies
to faithless lights , and gracious speech gainsaid
ABAB
i pray you , when yon river path i tread
make with the woodlands some soft compromise
lest they should vex me into fruitless sighs
with visions of a woman 's gleaming head
ABBA
for every green and golden hearted thing
that gathers beauty in that shining place
beloved of beams and wooed by wind and wing
is rife with glimpses of her marvellous face
ABAB
well , that 's the charge . and now i 'm here alone
i 've built a little wall of hun on hun
to shield me from the leaden bees that drone
( it saves me worry , and it hurts ‘ em none
ABAB
the only thing i 'm wondering is when
some stretcher men will stroll along my way
it is n't much that 's left of me , but then
where life is , hope is , so at least they say
ABAB
well , if i 'm spared i 'll be the happy lad
i tell you i wo n't envy any king
i 've stood the racket , and i 'm proud and glad
i 've had my crowning hour . oh , war 's the thing
ABAB
kneeling in prayer , her spirit rapt above
she meets with god , who bendeth , brooding low
in vast compassion humanward , and so
there comes upon her life the power of love
ABBA
rising — behold ! with pinions like a dove
an angel with a rod where row on row
of chaliced lilies spill supernal glow
which all her thought to wonder mute doth move
ABBA
then falls upon the rapture of her soul
dimly some vision of gethsemane
athwart the resurrection 's shining goal
and with uplifted hand she pleads as one
ABAB
and oh ! if a blissful communion with heaven
to earth wearied spirits has ever been given
if the loved and the distant , the lost and the dead
who smiled on our pathway a moment , and fled
AABB
who darkened our sunshine and saddened our mirth
to prove that the soul has no home upon earth
are sent in the night time of gloom and distress
as heralds of mercy to comfort and bless
AABB
to place , while the tempest is fearfully loud
the bright bow of peace on the dark thundercloud
to whisper of purer and holier ties
of a land where the blossom of joy never dies
AABB
in former days , just by cythera town
a monastery was , of some renown
with nuns the queens of beauty filled the place
and gay gallants you easily might trace
AABB
the courtier , citizen , and parson too
the doctor and the bachelor you 'd view
with eager steps :— all visits thither made
and ‘ mong the latter , one ( a pleasing blade
AABB
had free access : was thought a prudent friend
who might to sisters many comforts lend
was always closely shaved and nicely dressed
and ev'ry thing he said was well expressed
AABB
if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear
if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee
a wave to pant beneath thy power , and share
the impulse of thy strength , only less free
ABAB
scarce seem 'd a vision , i would ne'er have striven
as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need
o lift me as a wave , a leaf , a cloud
i fall upon the thorns of life ! i bleed
ABAB
the world , that cannot deeme of worthy things
when i doe praise her , say i doe but flatter
so does the cuckow , when the mavis * sings
begin his witlesse note apace to clatter
ABAB
deepe in the closet of my parts entyre
her worth is written with a golden quill
that me with heavenly fury doth inspire
and my glad mouth with her sweet prayses fill
ABAB
the increasing moonlight drifts across my bed
and on the church yard by the road , i know
it falls as white and noiselessly as snow
‘ twas such a night two weary summers fled
ABBA
the stars , as now , were waning overhead
listen ! again the shrill lipped bugles blow
where the swift currents of the river flow
past fredericksburg : far off the heavens are red
ABBA
with sudden conflagration : on yon height
linstock in hand , the gunners hold their breath
a signal rocket pierces the dense night
flings its spent stars upon the town beneath
ABAB
to this the king :— “ rejoice we then to day
and on the morrow marshal our array
the monarch quick commands the feast of joy
and social cares his buoyant mind employ
AABB
within a bower , beside a crystal spring
where opening flowers , refreshing odours fling
cheerful he sits , and forms the banquet scene
in regal splendour on the crowded green
AABB
and as around he greets his valiant bands
showers golden presents from his bounteous hands
voluptuous damsels trill the sportive lay
whose sparkling glances beam celestial day
AABB
god give us men ! a time like this demands
strong minds , great hearts , true faith , and ready hands
men whom the lust of office does not kill
men whom the spoils of office cannot buy
AABB
tall men , sun crowned , who live above the fog
in public duty and in private thinking
for while the rabble , with their thumb worn creeds
their large professions and their little deeds
AABB
death ! be not proud , though some have called thee
mighty and dreadful , for thou art not so
for those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
die not , poor death ! nor yet canst thou kill me
ABBA
from rest and sleep , which but thy picture be
much pleasure , then , from thee much more must flow
and soonest our best men with thee do go
rest of their bones , and soul 's delivery
ABBA
thou'rt slave to fate , chance , kings , and desperate men
and dost with poison , war , and sickness , dwell
and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
and better than thy stroke . why swell'st thou , then
ABBA
devouring time blunt thou the lion 's paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger 's jaws
and burn the long lived phoenix , in her blood
ABAB
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st
and do whate'er thou wilt swift footed time
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
ABAB
o carve not with thy hours my love 's fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beauty 's pattern to succeeding men
ABAB
pride of thy race ! before my mental eyes
i see thee , like another alfred rise
see honour splendent on thy ample brow
while thought and genius fill the orbs below
AABB
those beaming orbs ! where lofty sweetness shone
and where the soul sate smiling on her throne
depriv 'd too soon of that benignant ray
which impious dahab shudder 'd to survey
AABB
pale , bleeding , conquer 'd , dying , and forlorn
i see thee view the wretch with silent scorn
see thy cheek flush at the false tears he shed
and proudly turn away the languid head
AABB
i learnt to write to you in happier days
and every letter was a piece i chipped
from off my heart , a fragment newly clipped
from the mosaic of life ; its blues and grays
ABBA
its throbbing reds , i gave to earn your praise
to make a pavement for your feet i stripped
my soul for you to walk upon , and slipped
beneath your steps to soften all your ways
ABBA
but now my letters are like blossoms pale
we strew upon a grave with hopeless tears
i ask no recompense , i shall not fail
although you do not heed ; the long , sad years
ABAB
when she comes home again ! a thousand ways
i fashion , to myself , the tenderness
of my glad welcome : i shall tremble — yes
and touch her , as when first in the old days
ABBA
i touched her girlish hand , nor dared upraise
mine eyes , such was my faint heart 's sweet distress
then silence : and the perfume of her dress
the room will sway a little , and a haze
ABBA
cloy eyesight — soulsight , even — for a space
and tears — yes ; and the ache here in the throat
to know that i so ill deserve the place
her arms make for me ; and the sobbing note
ABAB
peace , the soul 's slumber , was round me shed
the sleep where thought lives , but its pain is dead
and my musings led me , a spirit band
through the wide realms of their native land
AABB
till i stood by the couch of the mighty dying
a lonely shore in the midnight lying
he lay as if he had laid him to sleep
and the stars above him their watch did keep
AABB
and the mournful wind with the dreamy sigh
the homeless wanderer of the sky
was the only attendant whose gentle breath
soothed him yet on the couch of death
AABB
o never say that i was false of heart
though absence seemed my flame to qualify
as easy might i from my self depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
ABAB
that is my home of love , if i have ranged
like him that travels i return again
just to the time , not with the time exchanged
so that my self bring water for my stain
ABAB
never believe though in my nature reigned
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be stained
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
ABAB
earth has not anything to show more fair
dull would he be of soul who could pass by
a sight so touching in its majesty
this city now doth like a garment wear
ABBA
the beauty of the morning ; silent , bare
ships , towers , domes , theaters , and temples lie
open unto the fields and to the sky
all bright and glittering in the smokeless air
ABBA
never did sun more beautifully steep
in his first splendor valley , rock , or hill
ne'er saw i , never felt , a calm so deep
the river glideth at his own sweet will
ABAB
comming to kisse her lyps , ( such grace i found
me seemd i smelt a gardin of sweet flowres
that dainty odours from them threw around
for damzels fit to decke their lovers bowres
ABAB
her goodly bosome lyke a strawberry bed
her neck lyke to a bounch of cullambynes
her brest lyke lillyes , ere their leaves be shed
her nipples lyke young blossomd jessemynes
ABAB
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes
and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he
remembered in what a haughtier guise
he had flung an alms to leprosie
ABAB
when he girt his young life up in gilded mail
and set forth in search of the holy grail
the heart within him was ashes and dust
he parted in twain his single crust
AABB
he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink
and gave the leper to eat and drink
‘ t was a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread
‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl
AABB
the day approaches , when a mystic power
shall summon mute antiquity , to tell
the buried glories of the long lost hour
and she will answer the enchanter 's spell
ABAB
then shall we hear what wondrous things befell
when the young world existed in its prime
the truths revealed will turn the wisest pale
that ignorance so long abused their time
ABAB
vainly may error blessed truth assail
with specious argument , and looking wise
exult , as millions worship at her shrine
yet , in the time ordained , shall truth arise
ABAB
these heapes of stones , these old wals which ye see
were first enclosures but of salvage soyle
and these brave pallaces , which maystred bee
of time , were shepheards cottages somewhile
ABAB
inclos 'd with hills , a winding valley lies
by nature form 'd for fraud , and fitted for surprise
a narrow track , by human steps untrode
leads , thro ’ perplexing thorns , to this obscure abode
AABB
high o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands
whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands
the top is level , an offensive seat
of war ; and from the war a safe retreat
AABB
for , on the right and left , is room to press
the foes at hand , or from afar distress
to drive ‘ em headlong downward , and to pour
on their descending backs a stony show'r
AABB
the elect angels and the souls in bliss
the citizens of heaven , when , that first day
my lady passed from me and went their way
of marvel and pity full , did round her press
ABBA
“ what light is this , and what new loveliness
they said among them ; “ for such sweet display
did never mount , that from the earth did stray
to this high dwelling , all this age , we guess
ABBA
she , well content her lodging chang 'd to find
shows perfect , by her peers most perfect placed
and now and then half turning looks behind
to see if i walk in the way she traced
ABAB
i think i should have loved you presently
and given in earnest words i flung in jest
and lifted honest eyes for you to see
and caught your hand against my cheek and breast
ABAB
and all my pretty follies flung aside
that won you to me , and beneath your gaze
naked of reticence and shorn of pride
spread like a chart my little wicked ways
ABAB
i , that had been to you , had you remained
but one more waking from a recurrent dream
cherish no less the certain stakes i gained
and walk your memory 's halls , austere , supreme
ABAB
and there i found him whom i went to find
a man of noble make and head uplift
of equal carriage , nature 's bounteous gift
for in no shelter had his generous mind
ABBA
grown flowers that need the winds , rough not unkind
the joiner 's bench taught him , with judgment swift
seen things to fashion , unseen things to sift
from all his face a living soul outshined
ABBA
telling of strength and inward quietude
his great hand shook mine greatly , and his eyes
looked straight in mine with spiritual replies
i left him , rich with overflowing good
ABBA
grief dies like joy ; the tears upon my cheek
will disappear like dew . dear god ! i know
thy kindly providence hath made it so
and thank thee for the law . i am too weak
ABBA
to make a friend of sorrow , or to wear
with that dark angel ever by my side
( though to thy heaven there be no better guide
a front of manly calm . yet , for i hear
ABBA
as islam 's prophet , when his last day drew
nigh to its close , besought all men to say
whom he had wronged , to whom he then should pay
a debt forgotten , or for pardon sue
ABBA
and , through the silence of his weeping friends
a strange voice cried : “ thou owest me a debt
“ allah be praised ! ” he answered . “ even yet
he gives me power to make to thee amends
ABBA
o friend ! i thank thee for thy timely word
so runs the tale . its lesson all may heed
for all have sinned in thought , or word , or deed
or , like the prophet , through neglect have erred
ABBA
the tree of faith its bare , dry boughs must shed
that nearer heaven the living ones may climb
the false must fail , though from our shores of time
the old lament be heard , “ great pan is dead
ABBA
that wail is error 's , from his high place hurled
this sharp recoil is evil undertrod
our time 's unrest , an angel sent of god
troubling with life the waters of the world
ABBA
even as they list the winds of the spirit blow
to turn or break our century rusted vanes
sands shift and waste ; the rock alone remains
where , led of heaven , the strong tides come and go
ABBA
soon as she spreads her hand , th ’ a ë rial guard
descend , and sit on each important card
first ariel perch 'd upon a matadore
then each , according to the rank they bore
AABB
for sylphs , yet mindful of their ancient race
are , as when women , wondrous fond of place
behold , four kings in majesty rever 'd
with hoary whiskers and a forky beard
AABB
and four fair queens whose hands sustain a flow'r
th ’ expressive emblem of their softer pow'r
four knaves in garbs succinct , a trusty band
caps on their heads , and halberts in their hand
AABB
two little children played among the flowers
their mothers were of kin , tho ’ far apart
the children 's ages were the very same
e'en to an hour — and ethel was her name
AABB
in withering heaps collects the flowery spoil
and each chill insect sinks beneath the soil
205 quick flies fair tulipa the loud alarms
and folds her infant closer in her arms
AABB
in some lone cave , secure pavilion , lies
and waits the courtship of serener skies
so , six cold moons , the dormouse charm 'd to rest
210 indulgent sleep ! beneath thy eider breast
AABB
sweet smile ! the daughter of the queene of love
expressing all thy mothers powrefull art
with which she wonts to temper angry iove
when all the gods he threats with thundring dart
ABAB
sweet is thy vertue , as thy selfe sweet art
for when on me thou shinedst late in sadnesse
a melting pleasance ran through every part
and me revived with hart robbing gladnesse
ABAB
‘ for this true nobleness i seek in vain
in woman and in man i find it not
i almost weary of my earthly lot
my life springs are dried up with burning pain
ABBA
thou find'st it not ? i pray thee look again
look inward through the depths of thine own soul
how is it with thee ? art thou sound and whole
doth narrow search show thee no earthly stain
ABBA
be noble ! and the nobleness that lies
in other men , sleeping , but never dead
will rise in majesty to meet thine own
then wilt thou see it gleam in many eyes
ABBA
if thou hadst built a temple , how my eye
had hungering fed thereon , from low browed crypt
up to the soaring pinnacles that , tipt
with stars , gave signal when the sun drew nigh
ABBA
dark caverns in and under ; vivid sky
its home and aim ! say , from the glory slipt
and down into the shadows dropt and dipt
or reared from darkness up so holy high
ABBA
thou build'st the temple of thy holy ghost
from hid foundation to high hidden fate
foot in the grave , head at the heavenly gate
from grave and sky filled with a fighting host
ABBA
‘ what had i lost , if , conjugally kind
by nature hating , yet by vows confined
untaught the matrimonial bonds to slight
and coldly conscious of a husband 's right
AABB
you had faint drawn me with a form alone
a lawful lump of life by force your own
then , while your backward will retrenched desire
and unconcurring spirits lent no fire
AABB
i had been born your dull , domestic heir
load of your life , and motive of your care
perhaps been poorly rich , and meanly great
the slave of pomp , a cipher in the state
AABB
next , ripe in yellow gold , a vineyard shines
bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines
a deeper dye the dangling clusters show
and curl ’ d on silver props , in order glow
AABB
a darker metal mix ’ d intrench ’ d the place
and pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace
to this , one pathway gently winding leads
where march a train with baskets on their heads
AABB
( fair maids and blooming youths ,) that smiling bear
the purple product of the autumnal year
to these a youth awakes the warbling strings
whose tender lay the fate of linus sings
AABB
next came a blooming boy in robe of green
on his fair brow a flowery crown was seen
where the pale primrose with the cowslip vied
and fragrant violets shone in purple pride
AABB
upon a bull he rode , whose horns were gay
with many a golden flower and budding spray
around him every vernal songster fled
while the lark soar 'd and whistled o'er his head
AABB
and now he smil 'd with joy , and now , apace
the crystal tears bedew 'd his alter 'd face
like the young fondling on his mother 's breast
who cries for absent joys , and thinks them best
AABB
how sweet to be thus nestling deep in boughs
upon an ashen stoven pillowing me
faintly are heard the ploughmen at their ploughs
but not an eye can find its way to see
ABAB
the sunbeams scarce molest me with a smile
so thickly the leafy armies gather round
and where they do , the breeze blows cool the while
their leafy shadows dancing on the ground
ABAB
full many a flower , too , wishing to be seen
perks up its head the hiding grass between
in mid wood silence , thus , how sweet to be
where all the noises , that on peace intrude
AABB
hide this one night thy crescent , kindly moon
so shall endymion faithful prove , and rest
loving and unawakened on thy breast
so shall no foul enchanter importune
ABBA
thy quiet course ; for now the night is boon
and through the friendly night unseen i fare
who dread the face of foemen unaware
and watch of hostile spies in the bright noon
ABBA
i never gave a lock of hair away
to a man , dearest , except this to thee
which now upon my fingers thoughtfully
i ring out to the full brown length and say
ABBA
“ take it . ” my day of youth went yesterday
my hair no longer bounds to my foot 's glee
nor plant i it from rose or myrtle tree
as girls do , any more : it only may
ABBA
once on the year 's last eve in my mind 's might
sitting in dreams , not sad , nor quite elysian
balancing all ‘ twixt wonder and derision
methought my body and all this world took flight
ABBA
and vanished from me , as a dream , outright
leaning out thus in sudden strange decision
i saw as it were in the flashing of a vision
far down between the tall towers of the night
ABBA
so , without overt breach , we fall apart
tacitly sunder — neither you nor i
conscious of one intelligible why
and both , from severance , winning equal smart
ABBA
so , with resigned and acquiescent heart
whene'er your name on some chance lip may lie
i seem to see an alien shade pass by
a spirit wherein i have no lot or part
ABBA
thus may a captive , in some fortress grim
from casual speech betwixt his warders , learn
that june on her triumphant progress goes
through arched and bannered woodlands ; while for him
ABBA
when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her , though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutor 'd youth
unskilful in the world 's false forgeries
ABAB
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although i know my years be past the best
i smiling credit her false speaking tongue
outfacing faults in love with love 's ill rest
ABAB
but wherefore says my love that she is young
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o , love 's best habit is a soothing tongue
and age , in love , loves not to have years told
ABAB
how anxious is the pensive parents ’ thought
how blest the lot of fondlings , early taught
joy strings her hours on pleasure 's golden twine
and fancy forms it to an endless line
AABB
but ah ! the charm must cease , or soon or late
when chicks and misses rise to woman 's state
the little tyrant grows in turn a slave
and feels the soft anxiety she gave
AABB
this truth , my pretty friend , an ancient sage
who wrote in tale and legend many a page
couch 'd in that age 's unaffected guise
when fables were the wisdom of the wise
AABB
lo ! o'er the welkin the tempestuous clouds
successive fly , and the loud piping wind
rocks the poor sea boy on the dripping shrouds
while the pale pilot , o'er the helm reclined
ABAB
lists to the changeful storm : and as he plies
his wakeful task , he oft bethinks him , sad
of wife , and little home , and chubby lad
and the half strangled tear bedews his eyes
ABBA
i , on the deck , musing on themes forlorn
view the drear tempest , and the yawning deep
nought dreading in the green sea 's caves to sleep
for not for me shall wife or children mourn
ABBA
whoever thinks a faultless piece to see
thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be
in every work regard the writer 's end
since none can compass more than they intend
AABB
and if the means be just , the conduct true
applause , in spight of trivial faults , is due
as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit
t ’ avoid great errors , must the less commit
AABB
neglect the rules each verbal critic lays
for not to know some trifles , is a praise
most critics , fond of some subservient art
still make the whole depend upon a part
AABB
another that has got a handsome wife
makes her the only heaven of his life
keeps her extravagantly , fine and gay
and never thinks she makes too much away
AABB
the treats and balls she is invited to
and he good man , consents that she shall go
believes her company is much desired
and 's proud to think she shou 'd be so admired
AABB
until at length , by chance he finds the truth
and catches her with some enamour 'd youth
surpriz 'd — but dare not make the matter known
conceals her shame , that he may hide his own
AABB
ah me ! the fifty years since last we met
seem to me fifty folios bound and set
by time , the great transcriber , on his shelves
wherein are written the histories of ourselves
AABB
what tragedies , what comedies , are there
what joy and grief , what rapture and despair
what chronicles of triumph and defeat
of struggle , and temptation , and retreat
AABB
what records of regrets , and doubts , and fears
what pages blotted , blistered by our tears
what lovely landscapes on the margin shine
what sweet , angelic faces , what divine
AABB
let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments . love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
ABAB
o , no ! it is an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wandering bark
whose worth 's unknown , although his height be taken
ABAB
love 's not time 's fool , though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickle 's compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
ABAB
thou mighty mars , the lord of soldiers brave
and thou mirnerve , that dost in wit excel
and thou apollo , who dost knowledge have
of every art that from parnassus fell
ABAB
with all your sisters that thereon do dwell
lament for him who duly serv 'd you all
whom in you wisely all your arts did mell
bewail ( i say ) his unexpected fall
ABAB
i need not in remembrance for to call
his race , his youth , the hope had of him ay
since that in him doth cruel death appall
both manhood , wit and learning every way
ABAB
if thou must love me , let it be for nought
except for love 's sake only . do not say
“ i love her for her smile — her look — her way
of speaking gently ,— for a trick of thought
ABBA
that falls in well with mine , and certes brought
a sense of pleasant ease on such a day
for these things in themselves , beloved , may
be changed , or change for thee ,— and love , so wrought
ABBA
may be unwrought so . neither love me for
thine own dear pity 's wiping my cheeks dry
a creature might forget to weep , who bore
thy comfort long , and lose thy love thereby
ABAB
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say ‘ this poet lies
such heavenly touches ne'er touch 'd earthly faces
ABAB
so should my papers , yellowed with their age
be scorn 'd , like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be term 'd a poet 's rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
ABAB
“ whatever toils the great ulysses pass 'd
beneath this happy roof they end at last
no longer now from shore to shore to roam
smooth seas and gentle winds invite him home
AABB
but hear me , princes ! whom these walls inclose
for whom my chanter sings : and goblet flows
with wine unmix 'd ( an honour due to age
to cheer the grave , and warm the poet 's rage
AABB
though labour 'd gold and many a dazzling vest
lie heap 'd already for our godlike guest
without new treasures let him not remove
large , and expressive of the public love
AABB
or i shall live your epitaph to make
or you survive when i in earth am rotten
from hence your memory death cannot take
although in me each part will be forgotten
ABAB
your name from hence immortal life shall have
though i ( once gone ) to all the world must die
the earth can yield me but a common grave
when you entombed in men 's eyes shall lie
ABAB
your monument shall be my gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall o'erhyppphenread
and tongues to be , your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead
ABAB
in march , his natal month , through sleet and rain
he bore his wife , who did not once complain
no wedding jaunt could their small means afford
yet they had pleasure in true love 's accord
AABB
and what they lacked in way of outward show
was quite made up by warm affection 's glow
they were a happy couple , with warm hearts
both striving eagerly to act their parts
AABB
if ever twain were blended into one
‘ twas in their case , as all who knew them own
he , working soon and late to rid his debt
she taking care of all he chanced to get
AABB
when i behold this tickle * trustles state
of vaine worlds glorie , flitting too and fro
and mortall men tossed by troublous fate
in restles seas of wretchednes and woe
ABAB
i wish i might this wearie life forgoe
and shortly turne unto my happie rest
where my free spirite might not anie moe
be vest with sights that doo her peace molest
ABAB
and ye , faire ladie , in whose bounteous brest
all heavenly grace and vertue shrined is
when ye these rythmes doo read , and vew the rest
loath this base world , and thinke of heavens blis
ABAB
you 've money ; learning is beyond your scope
deaf to your envy , stubborn to your hope
but if upon your undeserving head
science and letters had their glory shed
AABB
if in the cavern of your skull the light
of knowledge shone where now eternal night
breeds the blind , poddy , vapor fatted naughts
of cerebration that you think are thoughts
AABB
black bats in cold and dismal corners hung
that squeak and gibber when you move your tongue
you would not write , in avarice 's defense
a senseless eulogy on lack of sense
AABB
hopeless ! despairless ! like that indian wise
free of desire , save no desire to know
to gain that sweet nirvana each one tries
thinks to assuage soul wearing passion so
ABAB
from the white rest , the ante natal bliss
not loth , the wondrous wondering soul awakes
now drawn to that illusion , now to this
with gathering strength each devious pathway takes
ABAB
till at the noon of life his aims decline
evermore earthward bend the tiring eyes
evermore earthward , till with no surprise
they see nirvana from earth 's bosom shine
ABBA
i have dreamed sweet dreams of a summer night
when the moon was walking in cloudless light
and my soul to the regions of fancy sprung
while the spirits of air their soft anthems sung
AABB
strains wafted down from those heavenly spheres
which may not be warbled in waking ears
more sweet than the voice of waters flowing
than the breeze over beds of violets blowing
AABB
when it stirs the pines , and sultry day
fans himself cool with their tremulous play
on the sleeper 's ear those rich notes stealing
speak of purer and holier feeling
AABB
our land — our home — the common home indeed
of soil born children and adopted ones
the stately daughters and the stalwart sons
of industry —: all greeting and godspeed
ABBA
o home to proudly live for , and if need
be proudly die for , with the roar of guns
blent with our latest prayer —. so died men once
lo peace ...! as we look on the land they freed
ABBA
its harvests all in ocean over flow
poured round autumnal coasts in billowy gold
its corn and wine and balmed fruits and flow'rs
we know the exaltation that they know
ABBA
say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
and i will comment upon that offence
speak of my lameness , and i straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
ABAB
thou canst not ( love ) disgrace me half so ill
to set a form upon desired change
as i 'll my self disgrace , knowing thy will
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange
ABAB
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest i ( too much profane ) should do it wrong
and haply of our old acquaintance tell
ABAB
forgive me , dear , for thundering on thy name
sure ‘ tis thyself that shows my love distrest
for fire exhaled in freezing clouds possessed
warring for way , makes all the heavens exclaim
ABBA
thy beauty so , the brightest living flame
wrapt in my cloudy heart , by winter prest
scorning to dwell within so base a nest
thunders in me thy everlasting flame
ABBA
o that my heart might still contain that fire
or that the fire would always light my heart
then should'st thou not disdain my true desire
or think i wronged thee to reveal to my smart
ABAB
licia my love was sitting in a grove
tuning her smiles unto the chirping songs
but straight she spied where two together strove
each one complaining of the other 's wrongs
ABAB
cupid did cry lamenting of the harm
jove 's messenger , thou wrong'st me too too far
use thou thy rod , rely upon the charm
think not by speech my force thou canst debar
ABAB
a rod , sir boy , were fitter for a child
my weapons oft and tongue and mind you took
and in my wrong at my distress thou smiled
and scorned to grace me with a loving look
ABAB
he sniffs the chilly air ; ( his dreaming starts
he 's riding in a dusty sussex lane
in quiet september ; slowly night departs
and he 's a living soul , absolved from pain
ABAB
beyond the brambled fences where he goes
are glimmering fields with harvest piled in sheaves
and tree tops dark against the stars grown pale
then , clear and shrill , a distant farm cock crows
ABBA
and there 's a wall of mist along the vale
where willows shake their watery sounding leaves
he gazes on it all , and scarce believes
that earth is telling its old peaceful tale
ABBA
i . “ your buoyant troops on dimpling ocean tread
wafting the moist air from his oozy bed
aquatic nymphs !— you lead with viewless march
the winged vapours up the aerial arch
AABB
15 on each broad cloud a thousand sails expand
and steer the shadowy treasure o'er the land
through vernal skies the gathering drops diffuse
plunge in soft rains , or sink in silver dews
AABB
your lucid bands condense with fingers chill
20 the blue mist hovering round the gelid hill
in clay form 'd beds the trickling streams collect
strain through white sands , through pebbly veins direct
AABB
at last where hudson , with majestic pace
swells at the sight , and checks his rapid race
thro dark stillwater slow and silent moves
and flying troops with sullen pause reproves
AABB
seize their tried muskets , name their chiefs to lead
endorse their knapsacks and to vengeance speed
o'er all the land the kindling ardor flies
troop follows troop , and flags on flags arise
AABB
i think of thee !— my thoughts do twine and bud
about thee , as wild vines , about a tree
put out broad leaves , and soon there 's nought to see
except the straggling green which hides the wood
ABBA
yet , o my palm tree , be it understood
i will not have my thoughts instead of thee
who art dearer , better ! rather , instantly
renew thy presence ; as a strong tree should
ABBA
triumphant washington , with brow serene
regards unmoved the exhilarating scene
weighs in his balanced thought the silent grief
that sinks the bosom of the fallen chief
AABB
with all the joy that laurel crowns bestow
a world reconquer 'd and a vanquished foe
thus thro extremes of life , in every state
shines the clear soul , beyond all fortune great
AABB
while smaller minds , the dupes of fickle chance
slight woes o'erwhelm and sudden joys entrance
so the full sun , thro all the changing sky
nor blasts nor overpowers the naked eye
AABB
when i consider every thing that grows
holds in perfection but a little moment
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment
ABAB
when i perceive that men as plants increase
cheered and checked even by the self same sky
vaunt in their youthful sap , at height decrease
and wear their brave state out of memory
ABAB
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
sets you most rich in youth before my sight
where wasteful time debateth with decay
to change your day of youth to sullied night
ABAB
then he withdrew , in poverty and pain
to this small farm , the last of his domain
his only comfort and his only care
to prune his vines , and plant the fig and pear
AABB
his only forester and only guest
his falcon , faithful to him , when the rest
whose willing hands had found so light of yore
the brazen knocker of his palace door
AABB
had now no strength to lift the wooden latch
that entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch
companion of his solitary ways
purveyor of his feasts on holidays
AABB
voltaire , our england 's lover , man divine
beyond all gods that ever fear adored
by right and might , by sceptre and by sword
by godlike love of sunlike truth , made thine
ABBA
through godlike hate of falsehood 's marshlight shine
and all the fume of creeds and deeds abhorred
whose light was darkness , till the dawn star soared
truth , reason , mercy , justice , keep thy shrine
ABBA
sacred in memory 's temple , seeing that none
of all souls born to strive before the sun
loved ever good or hated evil more
the snake that felt thy heel upon her head
AABB
others have urg 'd ( but weigh it , and you 'll find
‘ tis light as feathers blown before the wind
that poverty , the curse of providence
attones for a dull writer 's want of sense
AABB
alas ! his dulness ‘ twas that made him poor
not vice versa : we infer no more
of vice and folly poverty 's the curse
heav'n may be rigid , but the man was worse
AABB
by good made bad , by favours more disgrac 'd
so dire th ’ effects of ignorance misplac 'd
of idle youth , unwatch 'd by parents eyes
of zeal for pence , and dedication lies
AABB
the wandering mariner , whose eye explores
the wealthiest isles , the most enchanting shores
views not a realm so bountiful and fair
nor breathes the spirit of a purer air
AABB
in every clime , the magnet of his soul
touched by remembrance , trembles to that pole
for in this land of heaven 's peculiar grace
the heritage of nature 's noblest race
AABB
there is a spot of earth supremely blest
a dearer , sweeter spot than all the rest
where man , creation 's tyrant , casts aside
his sword and sceptre , pageantry and pride
AABB
ah me ! and i am now the man whose muse
in happier times was wont to laugh at love
and those who suffer 'd that blind boy abuse
the noble gifts were given them from above
ABAB
the rumour runs that here in isis swim
such stately swans so confident in dying
that when they feel themselves near lethe 's brim
they sing their fatal dirge when death is nighing
ABAB
and i like these that feel my wounds are mortal
contented die for her whom i adore
and in my joyful hymns do still exhort all
to die for such a saint or love no more
ABAB
not that my torments or her tyranny
enforce me to enjoin so hard a task
but for i know , and yield no reason why
but will them try that have desire to ask
ABAB
“ behold the prizes , valiant greeks ! decreed
to the brave rulers of the racing steed
prizes which none beside ourself could gain
should our immortal coursers take the plain
AABB
( a race unrivall ’ d , which from ocean ’ s god
peleus received , and on his son bestow ’ d
but this no time our vigour to display
nor suit , with them , the games of this sad day
AABB
lost is patroclus now , that wont to deck
their flowing manes , and sleek their glossy neck
sad , as they shared in human grief , they stand
and trail those graceful honours on the sand
AABB
farewell ! thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou know'st thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
ABAB
thy self thou gav'st , thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gav'st it , else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again , on better judgement making
ABAB
yes ! let the rich deride , the proud disdain
these simple blessings of the lowly train
to me more dear , congenial to my heart
one native charm , than all the gloss of art
AABB
spontaneous joys , where nature has its play
the soul adopts , and owns their firstborn sway
lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind
unenvied , unmolested , unconfined
AABB
but the long pomp , the midnight masquerade
with all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed
in these , ere triflers half their wish obtain
the toiling pleasure sickens into pain
AABB
dear ! of all happy in the hour , most blest
he who has found our hid security
assured in the dark tides of the world that rest
and heard our word , ‘ who is so safe as we
ABAB
we have found safety with all things undying
the winds , and morning , tears of men and mirth
the deep night , and birds singing , and clouds flying
and sleep , and freedom , and the autumnal earth
ABAB
we have built a house that is not for time 's throwing
we have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever
war knows no power . safe shall be my going
secretly armed against all death 's endeavour
ABAB
thou art as tyrannous , so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
ABAB
yet in good faith some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan
to say they err , i dare not be so bold
although i swear it to my self alone
ABAB
and to be sure that is not false i swear
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face
one on another 's neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgment 's place
ABAB
and how felt he , the wretched man
reclining there — while memory ran
o'er many a year of guilt and strife
flew o'er the dark flood of his life
AABB
nor found one sunny resting place
nor brought him back one branch of grace
“ there was a time , ” he said , in mild
heart humbled tones , “ thou blessed child
AABB
when , young and haply pure as thou
i looked and prayed like thee — but now
he hung his head — each nobler aim
and hope , and feeling , which had slept
AABB
‘ dear native brook ! wild streamlet of the west
how many various fated years have passed
what blissful and what anguished hours , since last
i skimmed the smooth thin stone along thy breast
ABBA
numbering its light leaps ! yet so deep imprest
sink the sweet scenes of childhood , that mine eyes
i never shut amid the sunny haze
but straight with all their tints , thy waters rise
ABAB
thy crowning plank , thy margin 's willowy maze
and bedded sand that veined with various dyes
gleamed through thy bright transparence to the gaze
visions of childhood ! oft have ye beguiled
ABAB
thus am i mine own prison . everything
around me free and sunny and at ease
or if in shadow , in a shade of trees
which the sun kisses , where the gay birds sing
ABBA
then gaze i at the merrymaking crew
and smile a moment and a moment sigh
thinking : why can i not rejoice with you
but soon i put the foolish fancy by
ABAB
thy satin vesture richer is than looms
of orient weave for raiment of her kings
not dyes of olden tyre , not precious things
regathered from the long forgotten tombs
ABBA
of buried empires , not the iris plumes
that wave upon the tropics ’ myriad wings
not all proud sheba 's queenly offerings
could match the golden marvel of thy blooms
ABBA
for thou art nurtured from the treasure veins
of this fair land ; thy golden rootlets sup
her sands of gold — of gold thy petals spun
her golden glory , thou ! of hills and plains
ABBA
i watched them long in my curious dream
till they stood by the borders of the stream
then , just as i thought , the two ways met
but all the brethren were talking yet
AABB
and would talk on , till the heaving tide
carried them over , side by side
side by side , for the way was one
the toilsome journey of life was done
AABB
and priest and quaker , and all who died
came out alike on the other side
no forms , or crosses , or books had they
no gowns of silk , or suits of gray
AABB
cruel fair love , i justly do complain
of too much rigor and thy heart unkind
that for mine eyes thou hast my body slain
and would not grant that i should favour find
ABAB
i looked , fair love , and you my love looked fair
i sighed for love and you for sport did smile
your smiles were such as did perfume the air
and this perfum è d did my heart beguile
ABAB
thus i confess the fault was in mine eyes
begun with sighs and ended with a flame
i for your love did all the world despise
and in these poems honored have your name
ABAB
love and my love did range the forest wild
mounted alike , upon swift coursers both
love her encountered , though he was a child
“ let 's strive , ” saith he , whereat my love was wroth
ABAB
and scorned the boy , and checked him with a smile
“ i mounted am , and arm è d with my spear
thou art too weak , thyself do not beguile
i could thee conquer if i naked were
ABAB
with this love wept , and then my love replied
“ kiss me , sweet boy , so weep my boy no more
thus did my love , and then her force she tried
love was made ice , that fire was before
ABAB
‘ agreed ! ’ cried north ; thought he , this fall
with wheat and rye i 'll sow it all
in that way i shall get the start
and south may whistle for his part
AABB
so thought , so done , the field was sown
and , winter haying come and gone
sly north walked blithely forth to spy
the progress of his wheat and rye
AABB
heavens , what a sight ! his brother 's swine
had asked themselves all out to dine
such grunting , munching , rooting , shoving
the soil seemed all alive and moving
AABB
with nothing to wear , if the climate is suiting
we might get along i am sure pretty well
no washing and starching and crimping and fluting
no muslin and laces and trouble of dressing , they tell
ABAB
e'er troubles the women , or bothers the men
who soon grow accustomed , as people do here
to fashions prevailing , and things that they ken
to dresses fore shortened where bosoms appear
ABAB
to bonnets that show but a rose in the wearing
to dresses that sweep like a besom the street
to dresses so gauzy the hoops through are seen
to shoes quite as gauzy to cover the feet
ABAB
iii . art is the bond of weakness , and we find
therein acknowledgment of failing power
a man would worship , gazing on a flower
onward he passeth , lo his eyes are blind
ABBA
the unenlivened form he left behind
grew up within him only for an hour
and he will grapple with nature till the dower
of strength shall be retreasured in his mind
ABBA
and each form record is a high protest
of treason done unto the soul of man
which , striving upwards , ever is oppress 'd
by the old bondage , underneath whose ban
ABAB
there in the forum swarm a numerous train
the subject of debate , a townsman slain
one pleads the fine discharged , which one denied
and bade the public and the laws decide
AABB
the witness is produced on either hand
for this , or that , the partial people stand
the appointed heralds still the noisy bands
and form a ring , with sceptres in their hands
AABB
on seats of stone , within the sacred place
the reverend elders nodded o ’ er the case
alternate , each the attesting sceptre took
and rising solemn , each his sentence spoke
AABB
unrighteous lord of love , what law is this
that me thou makest thus tormented be
the whiles she lordeth in licentious blisse
of her freewill , scorning both thee and me
ABAB
see ! how the tyrannesse doth ioy to see
the hugh mass á cres which her eyes do make
and humbled harts brings captive unto thee
that thou of them mayst mightie vengeance take
ABAB
but her proud hart doe thou a little shake
and that high look , with which she doth comptroll
all this worlds pride , bow to a baser make
and al her faults in thy black booke enroll
ABAB
death ! be not proud , though some have called thee
mighty and dreadful , for thou art not so
for those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
die not , poor death ! nor yet canst thou kill me
ABBA
from rest and sleep , which but thy picture be
much pleasure , then , from thee much more must flow
and soonest our best men with thee do go
rest of their bones , and soul 's delivery
ABBA
thou'rt slave to fate , chance , kings , and desperate men
and dost with poison , war , and sickness , dwell
and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
and better than thy stroke . why swell'st thou , then
ABBA
the social laws from insult to protect
to cherish peace , to cultivate respect
the rich from wanton cruelty restrain
to smooth the bed of penury and pain
AABB
the hapless vagrant to his rest restore
the maze of fraud , the haunts of theft explore
the thoughtless maiden , when subdued by art
to aid , and bring her rover to her heart
AABB
wild riot 's voice with dignity to quell
forbid unpeaceful passions to rebel
wrest from revenge the meditated harm
for this fair justice raised her sacred arm
AABB
whence should they come , lady ! those happy days
that thy fair hand and gentle heart invoke
upon my head ? alas ! such do not rise
on any , of the many , who with sighs
AABB
evil , and few , upon this darksome earth
must be the days of all of mortal birth
then why not mine ? sweet lady ! wish again
not more of joy to me , but less of pain
AABB
pleased with our gay disports , the dame was wont
to set her wheel before the cottage front
and o'er her spectacles would often peer
to view our gambols , and our boyish gear
AABB
still as she look 'd , her wheel kept turning round
with its beloved monotony of sound
when tired with play , we 'd set us by her side
( for out of school she never knew to chide
AABB
and wonder at her skill — well known to fame
for who could match in spinning with the dame
her sheets , her linen , which she show 'd with pride
to strangers , still her thriftness testified
AABB
he spoke ; the goddess with the charming eyes
glows with celestial red , and thus replies
“ is this a scene for love ? on ida ’ s height
exposed to mortal and immortal sight
AABB
our joys profaned by each familiar eye
the sport of heaven , and fable of the sky
how shall i e ’ er review the blest abodes
or mix among the senate of the gods
AABB
shall i not think , that , with disorder ’ d charms
all heaven beholds me recent from thy arms
with skill divine has vulcan form ’ d thy bower
sacred to love and to the genial hour
AABB
one place there is — beneath the burial sod
where all mankind are equalized by death
another place there is — the fane of god
where all are equal who draw living breath
ABAB
juggle who will elsewhere with his own soul
playing the judas with a temporal dole
he who can come beneath that awful cope
in the dread presence of a maker just
AABB
“ ay ! quail and cringe and crook the supple knee
and beg thy life of me , thine enemy
whom thou , a moment since , didst doom to death
i will not breathe suspicion 's lightest breath
AABB
against thy vaunted fame : and even though
before all men thou'st sworn thyself my foe
and pledged thyself wrongly to wreak on me
thy utmost power of mortal injury
AABB
in spite of this , should i be first to die
and win the bowers of the blest on high
beside the golden gate of paradise
thee will i wait with ever watchful eyes
AABB
the fine delight that fathers thought ; the strong
spur , live and lancing like the blowpipe flame
breathes once and , quench è d faster than it came
leaves yet the mind a mother of immortal song
ABBA
nine months she then , nay years , nine years she long
within her wears , bears , cares and moulds the same
the widow of an insight lost she lives , with aim
now known and hand at work now never wrong
ABBA
sweet fire the sire of muse , my soul needs this
i want the one rapture of an inspiration
o then if in my lagging lines you miss
the roll , the rise , the carol , the creation
ABAB
when autumn suns are soft , and sea winds moan
and golden fruits make sweet the golden air
in gardens where the apple blossoms were
in these old springs before i walked alone
ABBA
i pass among the pathways overgrown
of all the former flowers that kissed your feet
remains a poppy , pallid from the heat
a wild poppy that the wild winds have sown
ABBA
alas ! the rose forgets your hands of rose
the lilies slumber in the lily bed
‘ tis only poppies in the dreamy close
the changeless , windless garden of the dead
ABAB
hard are the rocks , the marble , and the steel
the ancient oak with wind and weather tossed
but you , my love , far harder do i feel
than flint , or these , or is the winter 's frost
ABAB
my tears too weak , your heart they cannot move
my sighs , that rock , like wind it cannot rent
too tiger like you swear you cannot love
but tears and sighs you fruitless back have sent
ABAB
the frost too hard , not melted with my flame
i cinders am , and yet you feel no heat
surpass not these , sweet love , for very shame
but let my tears , my vows , my sighs entreat
ABAB
both'ring the flats assembled round the quod
the queerum queerly smear 'd with dirty black
the dolman sounding , while the sheriff 's nod
prepare the switcher to dead book the whack
ABAB
while in a rattle sit two blowens flash
salt tears fast streaming from each bungy eye
to nail the ticker , or to mill the cly
through thick and thin their busy muzzlers splash
ABBA
the mots lament for tyburn 's merry roam
that bubbl 'd prigs must at the new drop fall
and from the start the scamps are cropp 'd at home
all in the sheriff 's picture frame the call
ABAB
the almighty thunderer with a frown replies
that clouds the world , and blackens half the skies
“ strong god of ocean ! thou , whose rage can make
the solid earth ’ s eternal basis shake
AABB
what cause of fear from mortal works could move
the meanest subject of our realms above
where ’ er the sun ’ s refulgent rays are cast
thy power is honour ’ d , and thy fame shall last
AABB
but yon proud work no future age shall view
no trace remain where once the glory grew
the sapp ’ d foundations by thy force shall fall
and , whelm ’ d beneath the waves , drop the huge wall
AABB
in thronging crowds they issue to the plains
nor man nor woman in the walls remains
in every face the self same grief is shown
and troy sends forth one universal groan
AABB
at scaea ’ s gates they meet the mourning wain
hang on the wheels , and grovel round the slain
the wife and mother , frantic with despair
kiss his pale cheek , and rend their scatter ’ d hair
AABB
thus wildly wailing , at the gates they lay
and there had sigh ’ d and sorrow ’ d out the day
but godlike priam from the chariot rose
“ forbear ( he cried ) this violence of woes
AABB
woman ! when i behold thee flippant , vain
inconstant , childish , proud , and full of fancies
without that modest softening that enhances
the downcast eye , repentant of the pain
ABBA
that its mild light creates to heal again
e'en then , elate , my spirit leaps , and prances
e'en then my soul with exultation dances
for that to love , so long , i 've dormant lain
ABBA
but when i see thee meek , and kind , and tender
heavens ! how desperately do i adore
thy winning graces ;— to be thy defender
i hotly burn — to be a calidore
ABAB
dear chorister , who from those shadows sends
ere that the blushing morn dare show her light
such sad , lamenting strains , that night attends
become all ear ; stars stay to hear thy plight
ABAB
if one whose grief even reach of thought transcends
who ne'er , not in a dream , did taste delight
may thee importune who like case pretends
and seems to joy in woe , in woe 's despite
ABAB
tell me ( so may thou fortune milder try
and long , long sing ) for what thou thus complains
since winter 's gone , and sun in dappled sky
enamour 'd , smiles on woods and flowery plains
ABAB
he knows the sweet vexation in the strife
of love with time , this bard who fain would stray
to fairer place beyond the storms of life
with astral faces near him day by day
ABAB
in deep mossed dells the mellow waters flow
which best he loves ; for there the echoes , rife
with rich suggestions of his long ago
astarte , pass with thee ! and , far away
ABAB
dear southern seasons haunt the dreamy eye
spring , flower zoned , and summer , warbling low
in tasselled corn , alternate come and go
while gypsy autumn , splashed from heel to thigh
ABBA
love is a breach in the walls , a broken gate
where that comes in that shall not go again
love sells the proud heart 's citadel to fate
they have known shame , who love unloved . even then
ABAB
when two mouths , thirsty each for each , find slaking
and agony 's forgot , and hushed the crying
of credulous hearts , in heaven — such are but taking
their own poor dreams within their arms , and lying
ABAB
each in his lonely night , each with a ghost
some share that night . but they know love grows colder
grows false and dull , that was sweet lies at most
astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder
ABAB
aspect of life with blood ; it draws upon
sources beyond the common reach and lore
of mortals , to replenish at its core
the god impassioned energy of man
ABBA
and herewith all the worlds of deed and thought
quicken again with meaning — pulse and thrill
with deity — that had forgot his touch
there is not any act avails so much
AABB
o happy thames , that didst my stella bear
i saw thee with full many a smiling line
upon thy cheerful face joy 's livery wear
while those fair planets on thy streams did shine
ABAB
the boat for joy could not to dance forbear
while wanton winds , with beauties so divine
ravish 'd , stay 'd not , till in her golden hair
they did themselves ( o sweetest prison !) twine
ABAB
and fain those oeol 's youth there would their stay
have made ; but , forced by nature still to fly
first did with puffing kiss those locks display
she , so dishevell 'd , blush 'd . from window i
ABAB
each day , new proofs of new despair i find
that is , new deaths . no marvel then , though i
make exile my last help ; to th'end mine eye
should not behold the death to me assigned
ABBA
not that from death absence might save my mind
but that it might take death more patiently
like him , the which by judge condemned to die
to suffer with more ease , his eyes doth blind
ABBA
your lips in scarlet clad , my judges be
pronouncing sentence of eternal “ no
despair , the hangman that tormenteth me
the death i suffer is the life i have
ABAB
why have your hands long sithence traveiled
to frame this world , that doth endure so long
or why were not these romane palaces
made of some matter no lesse firme and strong
ABAB
i say not , as the common voyce doth say
that all things which beneath the moone have being
are temporall and subiect to decay
but i say rather , though not all agreeing
ABAB
who hath not glowed above the page where fame
hath fixed high caledon 's unconquered name
the mountain land which spurned the roman chain
and baffled back the fiery crested dane
AABB
whose bright claymore and hardihood of hand
no foe could tame — no tyrant could command
that race is gone — but still their children breathe
and glory crowns them with redoubled wreath
AABB
o'er gael and saxon mingling banners shine
and , england ! add their stubborn strength to thine
the blood which flowed with wallace flows as free
but now ‘ tis only shed for fame and thee
AABB
when i 've eat my fill and my belt is snug
i begin to think of my baccy plug
i whittle a fill in my horny palm
and the bowl of me old clay pipe i cram
AABB
i trim the edges , i tamp it down
i nurse a light with an anxious frown
i begin to draw , and my cheeks tuck in
and all my face is a blissful grin
AABB
and up in a cloud the good smoke goes
and the good pipe glimmers and fades and glows
in its throat it chuckles a cheery song
for i likes it hot and i likes it strong
AABB
so oft as i her beauty doe behold
and therewith doe her cruelty compare
i marvaile of what substance was the mould
the which her made attonce so cruell faire
ABAB
then needs another element inquire
whereof she mote be made ; that is , the skye
for to the heaven her haughty looks aspire
and eke her love is pure immortall hye
ABAB
with humble words , the wisest i could frame
and proffer 'd service , i repaid the dame
that , of her grace , she gave her maid to know
the secret meaning of this moral show
AABB
and she , to prove what profit i had made
of mystic truth , in fables first convey 'd
demanded , till the next returning may
whether the leaf or flower i would obey
AABB
i chose the leaf ; she smiled with sober cheer
and wish 'd me fair adventure for the year
and gave me charms and sigils , for defence
against ill tongues that scandal innocence
AABB
the castle gate stands open now
and the wanderer is welcome to the hall
as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough
no longer scowl the turrets tall
ABAB
the summer 's long siege at last is o'er
when the first poor outcast went in at the door
she entered with him in disguise
and mastered the fortress by surprise
AABB
there is no spot she loves so well on ground
she lingers and smiles there the whole year round
the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land
has hall and bower at his command
AABB
“ earth has not anything to show more fair
dull would he be of soul who could pass by
a sight so touching in its majesty
this city now doth , like a garment , wear
ABBA
the beauty of the morning ; silent , bare
ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples lie
open unto the fields , and to the sky
all bright and glittering in the open air
ABBA
never did sun more beautifully steep
in his first splendour , valley , rock or hill
ne'er saw i , never felt , a calm so deep
the river glideth at his own sweet will
ABAB
and placed at length the thorn where all was ease
the pow'rs divine alone it could displease
‘ twas pleasant them together to behold
the wives , in emulation , were not cold
AABB
in easy talk they 'd to each other say
how pleasing to exchange from day to day
what think you , neighbour , if , to try our luck
for once we 've something new , and valets truck
AABB
as gods for pride of power , till fire and air
made earth of all his godhead . lightning rent
the heart of empire 's lurid firmament
and laid the mortal core of manhood bare
ABBA
but when the calm crowned head that all revere
for valour higher than that which casts out fear
since fear came near it never , comes near death
blind murder cowers before it , knowing that here
AABB
of our possession . therefore come thou down
and be not over proud . the tale is told
how once alcmena 's son himself , being sold
was patient , though he liked not the slaves ’ mess
ABBA
and more , if fate must bring thee to this stress
praise god thou art come to a house of high report
and wealth from long ago . the baser sort
who have reaped some sudden harvest unforeseen
ABBA
when to the garden of untroubled thought
i came of late , and saw the open door
and wished again to enter , and explore
the sweet , wild ways with stainless bloom inwrought
ABBA
and bowers of innocence with beauty fraught
it seemed some purer voice must speak before
i dared to tread that garden loved of yore
that eden lost unknown and found unsought
ABBA
then just within the gate i saw a child
a stranger child , yet to my heart most dear
who held his hands to me and softly smiled
with eyes that knew no shade of sin or fear
ABAB
one day the doctor found the bottle full
and , being thirsty , took a vigorous pull
put back the “ elixir ” where ‘ t was always found
and had old dobbin saddled and brought round
AABB
— you know those old time rhubarb colored nags
that carried doctors and their saddle bags
sagacious beasts ! they stopped at every place
where blinds were shut — knew every patient 's case
AABB
looked up and thought — the baby 's in a fit
that wo n't last long — he 'll soon be through with it
but shook their heads before the knockered door
where some old lady told the story o'er
AABB
sol through white curtains shot a timorous ray
and oped those eyes that must eclipse the day
now lap dogs give themselves the rousing shake
and sleepless lovers , just at twelve , awake
AABB
thrice rung the bell , the slipper knocked the ground
and the pressed watch returned a silver sound
belinda still her downy pillow pressed
her guardian sylph prolonged the balmy rest
AABB
‘ twas he had summoned to her silent bed
the morning dream that hovered o'er her head
a youth more glittering than a birth night beau
( that even in slumber caused her cheek to glow
AABB
and yet i cannot reprehend the flight
or blame th'attempt , presuming so to soar
the mounting venture for a high delight
did make the honour of the fall the more
ABAB
for who gets wealth , that puts not from the shore
danger hath honours , great designs their fame
glory doth follow , courage goes before
and though th'event oft answers not the same
ABAB
suffice that high attempts have never shame
the mean observer whom base safety keeps
lives without honour , dies without a name
and in eternal darkness ever sleeps
ABAB
“ the branching forehead with diverging horns
crests the bold bull , the jealous stag adorns
fierce rival boars with side long fury wield
the pointed tusk , and guard with shoulder shield
AABB
bounds the dread tiger o'er the affrighted heath
arm 'd with sharp talons , and resistless teeth
the pouncing eagle bears in clinched claws
the struggling lamb , and rends with ivory jaws
AABB
the tropic eel , electric in his ire
alarms the waves with unextinguish 'd fire
the fly of night illumes his airy way
and seeks with lucid lamp his sleeping prey
AABB
for three and thirty years , a living seed
a lonely germ , dropt on our waste world 's side
thy death and rising thou didst calmly bide
sore companied by many a clinging weed
ABBA
sprung from the fallow soil of evil and need
hither and thither tossed , by friends denied
pitied of goodness dull , and scorned of pride
until at length was done the awful deed
ABBA
and thou didst lie outworn in stony bower
three days asleep — oh , slumber godlike brief
for man of sorrows and acquaint with grief
life seed thou diedst , that death might lose his power
ABBA
i raised her tenderly with pitying arms
and in a garden , far from life 's alarms
i buried her , and left her all alone
and wrote this epitaph upon the stone
AABB
“ peace to her ashes , but not peace to those
her erewhile friends , the cause of all her woes
who fondled and caressed her for a space
who loved to stroke her soft , confiding face
AABB
who gave her food and shelter from her birth
who joined in all her harmless youthful mirth
but , when they went for holidays to roam
shut to the door of what had been her home
AABB
alone , beneath the tower whence thunder forth
the mandates of the tyrant of the north
poland 's sad genius kneels , absorbed in tears
bound , vanquished , pallid with her fears
AABB
alas ! the crucifix is all that 's left
to her , of freedom and her sons bereft
and on her royal robe foul marks are seen
where russian hectors ’ scornful feet have been
AABB
anon she hears the clank of murd'rous arms
the swordsmen come once more to spread alarms
and while she weeps against the prison walls
and waves her bleeding arm until it falls
AABB
some prouder muse , when comes the hour at last
may shake our hillsides with her bugle blast
not ours the task ; but since the lyric dress
relieves the statelier with its sprightliness
AABB
hear an old song , which some , perchance , have seen
in stale gazette or cobwebbed magazine
there was an hour when patriots dared profane
the mast that britain strove to bow in vain
AABB
and one , who listened to the tale of shame
whose heart still answered to that sacred name
whose eye still followed o'er his country 's tides
thy glorious flag , our brave old ironsides
AABB
next bidding all draw near on bended knees
the queen confers her titles and degrees
her children first of more distinguish 'd sort
who study shakspeare at the inns of court
AABB
impale a glow worm , or vert ú profess
shine in the dignity of f. r. s
some , deep freemasons , join the silent race
worthy to fill pythagoras 's place
AABB
some botanists , or florists at the least
or issue members of an annual feast
nor pass 'd the meanest unregarded ; one
rose a gregorian , one a gormogon
AABB
high deeds , o germans , are to come from you
thus in your books the record shall be found
“ a watchword was pronounced , a potent sound
arminius !— all the people quaked like dew
ABBA
stirr 'd by the breeze — they rose , a nation , true
true to itself — the mighty germany
she of the danube and the northern sea
she rose ,— and off at once the yoke she threw
ABBA
all power was given her in the dreadful trance
those new born kings she wither 'd like a flame
— woe to them all ! but heaviest woe and shame
to that bavarian , who did first advance
ABBA
whatever spirit , careless of his charge
his post neglects , or leaves the fair at large
shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins
be stopp 'd in vials , or transfix 'd with pins
AABB
or plung 'd in lakes of bitter washes lie
or wedg 'd whole ages in a bodkin 's eye
gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain
while clogg 'd he beats his silken wings in vain
AABB
oft in the after days , when thou and i
have fallen from the scope of human view
when , both together , under the sweet sky
we sleep beneath the daisies and the dew
ABAB
men will recall thy gracious presence bland
conning the pictured sweetness of thy face
will pore o'er paintings by thy plastic hand
and vaunt thy skill and tell thy deeds of grace
ABAB
oh , may they then , who crown thee with true bays
saying , “ what love unto her son she bore
make this addition to thy perfect praise
“ nor ever yet was mother worshipped more
ABAB
our love is not a fading earthly flower
its wing è d seed dropped down from paradise
and , nursed by day and night , by sun and shower
doth momently to fresher beauty rise
ABAB
to us the leafless autumn is not bare
nor winter 's rattling boughs lack lusty green
our summer hearts make summer 's fullness where
no leaf or bud or blossom may be seen
ABAB
for nature 's life in love 's deep life doth lie
love ,— whose forgetfulness is beauty 's death
whose mystic key these cells of thou and i
into the infinite freedom openeth
ABAB
i saw her like a shadow on the sky
in the last light , a blur upon the sea
then the gale 's darkness put the shadow by
but from one grave that island talked to me
ABAB
and , in the midnight , in the breaking storm
i saw its blackness and a blinking light
and thought , “ so death obscures your gentle form
so memory strives to make the darkness bright
ABAB
and , in that heap of rocks , your body lies
part of the island till the planet ends
my gentle comrade , beautiful and wise
part of this crag this bitter surge offends
ABAB
so ful of sorwe am i , soth for to seyne
that certeynly no more harde grace
may sitte on me , for why ther is no space
` if god wole thou art not agast of me
ABBA
how can i think , or edge my thoughts to action
when the miserly press of each day ’ s need
aches to a narrowness of spilled distraction
my soul appalled at the world ’ s work ’ s time greed
ABAB
how can i pause my thoughts upon the task
my soul was born to think that it must do
when every moment has a thought to ask
to fit the immediate craving of its cue
ABAB
“ those toils ( telemachus serene replies
have charms , with all their weight , t'allure the wise
fast by the throne obsequious fame resides
and wealth incessant rolls her golden tides
AABB
nor let antinous rage , if strong desire
of wealth and fame a youthful bosom fire
elect by jove , his delegate of sway
with joyous pride the summons i 'd obey
AABB
whene'er ulysses roams the realm of night
should factious power dispute my lineal right
some other greeks a fairer claim may plead
to your pretence their title would precede
AABB
if i leave all for thee , wilt thou exchange
and be all to me ? shall i never miss
home talk and blessing and the common kiss
that comes to each in turn , nor count it strange
ABBA
when i look up , to drop on a new range
of walls and floors , another home than this
nay , wilt thou fill that place by me which is
filled by dead eyes too tender to know change
ABBA
that 's hardest . if to conquer love , has tried
to conquer grief , tries more , as all things prove
for grief indeed is love and grief beside
alas , i have grieved so i am hard to love
ABAB
then meeting street first knew st. michael 's steeple
when redcoats marched with royal drums a banging
or merchants stopped gowned tutors to inquire
why school let out to see a pirate hanging
ABAB
and gentlemen took supper in the street
when candle shine from tables guled the dark
while others passing by would be discreet
and take the farther side without remark
ABAB
pausing perhaps to snuff the balmy savor
of turtle soup mulled with the bay leaves ’ flavor
these walls beheld them , and these lingering trees
that still preempt the middle of the gutter
AABB
batter my heart , three person 'd god , for you
as yet but knock ; breathe , shine , and seek to mend
that i may rise and stand , o'erthrow me , and bend
your force to break , blow , burn , and make me new
ABBA
i , like an usurped town , to another due
labour to admit you , but oh ! to no end
reason , your viceroy in me , we should defend
but is captived , and proves weak or untrue
ABBA
down in the redwood canyons cool and deep
the shadows of the forest ever sleep
the odorous redwoods , wet with fog and dew
touch with the bay and mingle with the yew
AABB
under the firs the red madrona shines
the graceful tan oaks , fairest of them all
lean lovingly unto the sturdy pines
in whose far tops the birds of passage call
ABAB
here , where the forest shadows ever sleep
the mountain lily lifts its chalice white
the myriad ferns hang draperies soft and white
thick on each mossy bank and watered steep
ABBA
no longer mourn for me when i am dead
than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
ABAB
nay if you read this line , remember not
the hand that writ it , for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
ABAB
o if ( i say ) you look upon this verse
when i ( perhaps ) compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse
but let your love even with my life decay
ABAB
look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile the world , unbless some mother
ABAB
for where is she so fair whose uneared womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his self love to stop posterity
ABAB
thou art thy mother 's glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime
so thou through windows of thine age shalt see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
ABAB
but hark ! the doors on jarring hinges turn
all enter in , and the blest scene 's begun
a thousand lights their livid flames display
pour forth their blaze , and form a mimick day
AABB
sudden a motley mixture fills the place
and footmen shine as lordly as his grace
to see the sad effect and power of change
ladies turn 'd men , in breeches freely range
AABB
young smooth chin 'd beaux turn priests and fryars
and nun 's chaste habits hide our country ‘ squires
belles , beaux , and sharpers here together play
and wives throw their good spouses wealth away
AABB
and izdubar turned from the halls and goes
toward a fountain in the park , whence flows
a merry stream toward the wood . he finds
an axe beside the fount , and thoughtful winds
AABB
through groves of sandal wood and mastic trees
and algum , umritgana . now he sees
the sig a ri and ummakana , pines
with babuaku ; and ri wood brightly shines
AABB
among the azuhu ; all precious woods
that man esteems are grown around , each buds
continuous in the softened , balmy air
he stops beneath a musrilkanna where
AABB
care charmer sleep , son of the sable night
brother to death , in silent darkness born
relieve my anguish , and restore the light
with dark forgetting of my care , return
ABAB
and let the day be time enough to mourn
the shipwreck of my ill advised youth
let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn
without the torments of the night 's untruth
ABAB
cease , dreams , the images of day desires
to model forth the passions of to morrow
never let the rising sun prove you liars
to add more grief , to aggravate my sorrow
ABAB
to night the sea sends up a gulf like sound
and ancient rhymes are ringing in my head
the many lilts of song we sang and said
my friend and brother , when we journeyed round
ABBA
our haunts at wollongong , that classic ground
for me at least , a lingerer deeply read
and steeped in beauty . oft in trance i tread
those shining shores , and hear your talk of fame
ABBA
with thought flushed face and heart so well assured
( beholding through the woodland 's bright distress
the moon half pillaged of her loveliness
of this wild dreamer : had you but endured
ABBA
the good shah akbar ( peace be his alway
came forth from the divan at close of day
bowed with the burden of his many cares
worn with the hearing of unnumbered prayers
AABB
wild cries for justice , the importunate
appeals of greed and jealousy and hate
and all the strife of sect and creed and rite
santon and gouroo waging holy fight
AABB
for the wise monarch , claiming not to be
allah 's avenger , left his people free
with a faint hope , his book scarce justified
that all the paths of faith , though severed wide
AABB
for loe , my love doth in her selfe containe
all this worlds riches that may farre be found
if saphyres , loe , her eies be saphyres plaine
if rubies , loe , hir lips be rubies sound
ABAB
if pearles , hir teeth be pearles , both pure and round
if yvorie , her forhead yvory weene
if gold , her locks are finest gold on ground
if silver , her faire hands are silver sheene
ABAB
with verdant light the modest emeralds glow
blue sapphires glare , and rubies blush , below
light piers of lazuli the dome surround
400 and pictured mochoes tesselate the ground
AABB
in glittering threads along reflective walls
the warm rill murmuring twinkles , as it falls
now sink the eolian strings , and now they swell
and echoes woo in every vaulted cell
AABB
in time the strong and stately turrets fall
in time the rose and silver lilies die
in time the monarchs captive are and thrall
in time the sea and rivers are made dry
ABAB
the hardest flint in time doth melt asunder
still living fame in time doth fade away
the mountains proud we see in time come under
and earth for age we see in time decay
ABAB
the sun in time forgets for to retire
from out the east where he was wont to rise
the basest thoughts we see in time aspire
and greedy minds in time do wealth despise
ABAB
dear fellow traveller ! here we are once more
the cock that crows , the smoke that curls , that sound
of bells , those boys that in yon meadow ground
in white sleev 'd shirts are playing by the score
ABBA
and even this little river 's gentle roar
all , all are english . oft have i look 'd round
with joy in kent 's green vales ; but never found
myself so satisfied in heart before
ABBA
europe is yet in bonds ; but let that pass
thought for another moment . thou art free
my country ! and ‘ tis joy enough and pride
for one hour 's perfect bliss , to tread the grass
ABBA
his nell sat on newgate steps , and scratch 'd her poll
her eyes suffus 'd with tears , and bung 'd with gin
the session 's sentence wrung her to the soul
nor could she lounge the gag to shule a win
ABAB
the knowing bench had tipp 'd her buzer queer
for dick had beat the hoof upon the pad
of field , or chick lane — was the boldest lad
that ever mill 'd the cly , or roll 'd the leer
ABBA
and with nell he kept a lock , to fence , and tuz
and while his flaming mot was on the lay
with rolling kiddies , dick would dive and buz
and cracking kens concluded ev'ry day
ABAB
then , too , the scenes of pomp and joy that make
one theatre of this vast peopled lake
where all that love , religion , commerce gives
of life and motion , ever moves and lives
AABB
here , up in the steps of temples , from the wave
ascending , in procession slow and grave
priests in white garments go , with sacred wands
and silver cymbals gleaming in their hands
AABB
this touch ’ d his generous heart , and from the tent
along the shore with hasty strides he went
soon as he came , where , on the crowded strand
the public mart and courts of justice stand
AABB
where the tall fleet of great ulysses lies
and altars to the guardian gods arise
there , sad , he met the brave euaemon ’ s son
large painful drops from all his members run
AABB
an arrow ’ s head yet rooted in his wound
the sable blood in circles mark ’ d the ground
as faintly reeling he confess ’ d the smart
weak was his pace , but dauntless was his heart
AABB
an angel spoke with me , and lo , he hoarded
my falling tears to cheer a flower 's face
for , so it seems , in all the heavenly space
a wasted grief was never yet recorded
ABBA
victorious calm those holy tones afforded
unto my soul , whose outcry , in disgrace
changed to low music , leading to the place
where , though well armed , with futile end awarded
ABBA
my past lay dead . “ wars are of earth ! ” he cried
“ endurance only breathes immortal air
courage eternal , by a world defied
still wears the front of patience , smooth and fair
ABAB
a stronger gust catches the cloud and twists
a spindle of rifted darkness through its heart
a gash in the damp grey , which , thrust apart
reveals black depths a moment . then the mists
ABBA
shut down again ; a white uneasy sea
heaves round the climbers and beneath their feet
he strains on upwards through the wind and sleet
poised , or swift moving , or laboriously
ABBA
lifting his weight . and if he should let go
what would he find down there , down there below
the curtain of the mist ? what would he find
beyond the dim and stifling now and here
AABB
the husband quite astonished now appeared
at once a hundred diff'rent ills he feared
but questioning his wife howe'er , he found
that many other dames who lived around
AABB
like her ; in paying tithes , the monks obeyed
which consolation to his breast conveyed
poor innocent ! she nothing wished to hide
said she , not one but tithe they make provide
AABB
good friar aubrey takes your sister 's dues
to father fabry mrs. b 's accrues
the mayoress friar william likes to greet
a monk more handsome scarcely you will meet
AABB
lyke as the culver * on the bared bough
sits mourning for the absence of her mate
and in her songs sends many a wishful vow
for his returns , that seemes to linger late
ABAB
so i alone , how left disconsolate
mourne to my selfe the absence of my love
and wandring here and there all desolate
seek with my playnts to match that mournful dove
ABAB
ne ioy of ought that under heaven doth hove
can comfort me , but her owne ioyous sight
whose sweet aspect both god and man can move
in her unspotted pleasauns to delight
ABAB
feronde , a rich , but awkward , vulgar clown
a ninny was believed throughout the town
he had the charge of revenues not slight
which he collected for a friar white
AABB
of these i 've known as good as any black
when husbands some assistance seemed to lack
and had so much to do , they monks might need
or other friends , their work at home to speed
AABB
this friar for to morrow never thought
but squandered ev'ry thing as soon as brought
no saint apostle less of wealth retained
good cheer o'er ev'ry wish triumphant reigned
AABB
old friend , farewell ! your kindly door again
i enter , but the master 's hand in mine
no more clasps welcome , and the temperate wine
that cheered our long nights , other lips must stain
ABBA
all is unchanged , but i expect in vain
the face alert , the manners free and fine
the seventy years borne lightly as the pine
wears its first down of snow in green disdain
ABBA
much did he , and much well ; yet most of all
i prized his skill in leisure and the ease
of a life flowing full without a plan
for most are idly busy ; him i call
ABBA
in quest of peace great montezuma stands
a sovereign supplicant with lifted hands
brings all his treasure , yields the regal sway
bids vassal millions their new lord obey
AABB
and plies the victor with incessant prayer
thro ravaged realms the harmless race to spare
but treasures , tears and sceptres plead in vain
nor threats can move him , nor a world restrain
AABB
while blind religion 's prostituted name
and monkish fury guide the sacred flame
o'er crowded fanes their fires unhallow 'd bend
climb the wide roofs , the lofty towers ascend
AABB
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear time 's waste
ABAB
then can i drown an eye ( unused to flow
for precious friends hid in death 's dateless night
and weep afresh love 's long since cancelled woe
and moan th ’ expense of many a vanished sight
ABAB
v. vice is a monster of so frightful mien
as , to be hated , needs but to be seen
yet seen too oft , familiar with her face
we first endure , then pity , then embrace
AABB
but where th ’ extreme of vice , was ne'er agreed
ask where 's the north ? at york , ‘ tis on the tweed
in scotland , at the orcades ; and there
at greenland , zembla , or the lord knows where
AABB
no creature owns it in the first degree
but thinks his neighbour further gone than he
even those who dwell beneath its very zone
or never feel the rage , or never own
AABB
i think if you had loved me when i wanted
if i 'd looked up one day , and seen your eyes
and found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted
and your brown face , that 's full of pity and wise
ABAB
flushed suddenly ; the white godhead in new fear
intolerably so struggling , and so shamed
most holy and far , if you 'd come all too near
if earth had seen earth 's lordliest wild limbs tamed
ABAB
shaken , and trapped , and shivering , for my touch
myself should i have slain ? or that foul you
but this the strange gods , who had given so much
to have seen and known you , this they might not do
ABAB
thou man of science , who , with practised eye
and glance untiring sweep'st the starry sky
speeding in thought along those trackless ways
where planets burn and constellations blaze
AABB
leaving uncounted worlds behind thee far
listen — “ i am the bright and morning star
he says — and does not thought more gladly stray
where the meek herald of the rising day
AABB
sits like a peaceful vestal bearing high
her radiant urn on the soft eastern sky
thence , rising , seek the morning star of heaven
who to night 's myriad suns their light has given
AABB
“ o jove ( he cried ) o all ye powers above
see the lewd dalliance of the queen of love
me , awkward me , she scorns ; and yields her charms
to that fair lecher , the strong god of arms
AABB
if i am lame , that stain my natal hour
by fate imposed ; such me my parent bore
why was i born ? see how the wanton lies
oh sight tormenting to a husband 's eyes
AABB
but yet , i trust , this once e'en mars would fly
his fair one 's arms — he thinks her , once , too nigh
but there remain , ye guilty , in my power
till jove refunds his shameless daughter 's dower
AABB
as to a child , i talked my heart asleep
with empty promise of the coming day
and it slept rather for my words made sleep
than from a thought of what their sense did say
ABAB
for did it care for sense , would it not wake
and question closer to the morrow ’ s pleasure
would it not edge nearer my words , to take
the promise in the meting of its measure
ABAB
so , if it slept , ’ twas that it cared but for
the present sleepy use of promised joy
thanking the fruit but for the forecome flower
which the less active senses best enjoy
ABAB
and rested at the foot of those wild hills
the rugged founts of the per æ an rills
and of that other ridge whose barren back
stretches , with all its mist and cloudy rack
AABB
south westward to cleone . there she stood
about a young bird 's flutter from a wood
fair , on a sloping green of mossy tread
by a clear pool , wherein she passioned
AABB
ever athwart life 's sunlit , upland ways
falleth the shadow of impending death
and still life 's flowers beneath his blighting breath
to ashes wither , and to dust , her bays
ABBA
what were the worth of hard won power or praise
awaits us all the grave cell dark and deep
the greedy grave worm 's maw , the awful sleep
when death his cold hand on our pulses lays
ABBA
and many other birds forbore their notes
leaping from tree to tree , as she along
the panting bosom of the current floats
rapt with the music of her dying song
ABAB
when from a thick and all entangled spring
a neatherd rude came with no small ado
dreading an ill presage to hear her sing
and quickly struck her tender neck in two
ABAB
another battle ! and the sounds have rolled
by many a gloomy gorge and wasted plain
o'er huddled hills and mountains manifold
like winds that run before a heavy rain
ABAB
when autumn lops the leaves and drooping grain
and earth lies deep in brown and cloudy gold
my brothers , lo ! our grand old england stands
with weapons gleaming in her ready hands
AABB
outside the tumult ! let us watch and trust
that she will never darken in the dust
and drift of wild contention , but remain
the hope and stay of many troubled lands
AABB
like as the dove , which seeled up doth fly
is neither freed , nor yet to service bound
but hopes to gain some help by mounting high
till want of force do force her fall to ground
ABAB
right so my mind , caught by his guiding eye
and thence cast off where his sweet hurt he found
hath neither leave to live , nor doom to die
nor held in evil , nor suffered to be sound
ABAB
but with his wings of fancies up he goes
to high conceits , whose fruits are oft but small
till wounded , blind , and wearied spirit , lose
both force to fly , and knowledge where to fall
ABAB
ye heavenly spirites , whose ashie cinders lie
under deep ruines , with huge walls opprest
but not your praise , the which shall never die
through your faire verses , ne in ashes rest
ABAB
if so be shrilling voyce of wight alive
may reach from hence to depth of darkest hell
then let those deep abysses open rive
that ye may understand my shreiking yell
ABAB
thrice having seene under the heavens veale
your toombs devoted compasse over all
thrice unto you with lowd voyce i appeale
and for your antique furie here doo call
ABAB
whoever hath her wish , thou hast thy will
and ‘ will ’ to boot , and ‘ will ’ in over plus
more than enough am i that vex thee still
to thy sweet will making addition thus
ABAB
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
shall will in others seem right gracious
and in my will no fair acceptance shine
ABAB
the sea all water , yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store
so thou being rich in will add to thy will
one will of mine to make thy large will more
ABAB
as to some lovely temple , tenantless
long since , that once was sweet with shivering brass
knowing well its altars ruined and the grass
grown up between the stones , yet from excess
ABBA
your body was a temple to delight
cold are its ashes whence the breath is fled
yet here one time your spirit was wont to move
here might i hope to find you day or night
ABBA
o son of man , by lying tongues adored
by slaughterous hands of slaves with feet red shod
in carnage deep as ever christian trod
profaned with prayer and sacrifice abhorred
ABBA
and incense from the trembling tyrant 's horde
brute worshippers or wielders of the rod
most murderous even of all that call thee god
most treacherous even that ever called thee lord
ABBA
face loved of little children long ago
head hated of the priests and rulers then
if thou see this , or hear these hounds of thine
run ravening as the gadarean swine
AABB
wrapp 'd in the embrace of sleep , the faithful train
o'er seas convey 'd me to my native reign
embroider 'd vestures , gold , and brass , are laid
conceal 'd in caverns in the sylvan shade
AABB
hither , intent the rival rout to slay
and plan the scene of death , i bend my way
so pallas wills — but thou , my son , explain
the names and numbers of the audacious train
AABB
“ st. george for merrie england ! ” let us cry
and each a red rose pin upon his breast
then face the foe with fearless front and eye
through all our frowning leaguer in the west
ABAB
for not alone his patron day it is
wherefrom our noble george hath drawn his name
three centuries and a half gone by ere this
by shakespeare 's birth it won a second fame
ABAB
a greater glory is its crown to day
since at its first and faintest uttered breath
a mighty angel rolled the stone away
that sealed his tomb who captive now leads death
ABAB
“ once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee
and was the safeguard of the west : the worth
of venice did not fall below her birth
venice , the eldest child of liberty
ABBA
she was a maiden city , bright and free
no guile seduced , no force could violate
and , when she took unto herself a mate
she must espouse the everlasting sea
ABBA
and what if she had seen those glories fade
those titles vanish , and that strength decay
yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
when her long life hath reached its final day
ABAB
stern be the pilot in the dreadful hour
when a great nation , like a ship at sea
with the wroth breakers whitening at her lee
feels her last shudder if her helmsman cower
ABBA
from our hot records then thy name shall stand
on time 's calm ledger out of passionate days
with the pure debt of gratitude begun
and only paid in never ending praise
ABAB
at length a wedding much attention caught
the lads and lasses of the hamlet sought
to see the couple pass : the belle perceived
the very man for whom her bosom heaved
AABB
and loudly cried , behold scamander 's flood
which raised surprise ; soon numbers round her stood
astonishment expressed , but still the fair
whate'er was asked , would nothing more declare
AABB
than , in the spacious , blue , ethereal sky
her marriage would be soon , they might rely
a laugh prevailed ; for what was to be done
the god with hasty steps away had run
AABB
this lamb , whose death with life the world hath blest
was from the world 's beginning slain , and he
hath made two wills , which , with the legacy
of his and thy kingdom , thy sons invest
ABBA
yet such are these laws , that men argue yet
whether a man those statutes can fulfil
none doth ; but thy all healing grace and spirit
revive again what law and letter kill
ABAB
if i should learn , in some quite casual way
that you were gone , not to return again
read from the back page of a paper , say
held by a neighbor in a subway train
ABAB
how at the corner of this avenue
and such a street ( so are the papers filled
a hurrying man — who happened to be you
at noon to day had happened to be killed
ABAB
i should not cry aloud — i could not cry
aloud , or wring my hands in such a place
i should but watch the station lights rush by
with a more careful interest on my face
ABAB
the curtains were half drawn , the floor was swept
and strewn with rushes , rosemary and may
lay thick upon the bed on which i lay
where through the lattice ivy shadows crept
ABBA
he leaned above me , thinking that i slept
and could not hear him ; but i heard him say
‘ poor child , poor child : ’ and as he turned away
came a deep silence , and i knew he wept
ABBA
he did not touch the shroud , or raise the fold
that hid my face , or take my hand in his
or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head
he did not love me living ; but once dead
AABB
stranger than any book i 've ever read
here on the reeking battlefield i lie
under the stars , propped up with smeary dead
like too , if no one takes me in , to die
ABAB
hit on the arms , legs , liver , lungs and gall
damn glad there 's nothing more of me to hit
but calm , and feeling never pain at all
and full of wonder at the turn of it
ABAB
for of the dead around me three are mine
three foemen vanquished in the whirl of fight
so if i die i have no right to whine
i feel i 've done my little bit all right
ABAB
the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts
and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts
at this , the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook
a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look
AABB
she sees , and trembles at the approaching ill
just in the jaws of ruin , and codille
and now , ( as oft in some distemper 'd state
on one nice trick depends the general fate
AABB
an ace of hearts steps forth : the king unseen
lurk 'd in her hand , and mourn 'd his captive queen
he springs to vengeance with an eager pace
and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace
AABB
it seem 'd that art and nature had assembled
all pleasure there for which mans hart could long
and there a noyse alluring sleepe soft trembled
of manie accords , more sweete than mermaids song
ABAB
the seates and benches shone as yvorie
and hundred nymphes sate side by side about
when from nigh hills , with hideous outcrie
a troupe of satyres in the place did rout
ABAB
we cannot choose our sorrows . one there was
who , reverent of soul , and strong with trust
cried , ‘ god , though thou shouldst bow me to the dust
yet will i praise thy everlasting laws
ABBA
beggared , my faith would never halt or pause
but sing thy glory , feasting on a crust
only one boon , one precious boon i must
demand of thee , o opulent great cause
ABBA
let love stay with me , constant to the end
though fame pass by and poverty pursue
with freighted hold her life ship onward sailed
the world gave wealth , and pleasure , and a friend
ABBA
resembling none , and none so poor as i
poor to the world , and poor in each esteem
whose first born loves at first obscured did die
and bred no fame but flame of base misdeem
ABAB
under the ensign of whose tir è d pen
love 's legions forth have masked , by others masked
think how i live wrong è d by ill tongued men
not master of myself , to all wrongs tasked
ABAB
oh thou that canst , and she that may do all things
support these languishing conceits that perish
look on their growth ; perhaps these silly small things
may win this wordly palm , so you do cherish
ABAB
sometimes an action on the stage is shown
sometimes ‘ tis done elsewhere , and there made known
a thing when heard , remember , strikes less keen
on the spectator 's mind than when ‘ tis seen
AABB
yet ‘ twere not well in public to display
a business best transacted far away
and much may be secluded from the eye
for well graced tongues to tell of by and by
AABB
medea must not shed her children 's blood
nor savage atreus cook man 's flesh for food
nor philomel turn bird or cadmus snake
with people looking on and wide awake
AABB
the silvery dimness of a happy dream
i 've known of late . methought where byron moans
like some wild gulf in melancholy zones
i passed tear blinded . once a lurid gleam
ABBA
of stormy sunset loitered on the sea
while , travelling troubled like a straitened stream
the voice of shelley died away from me
still sore at heart , i reached a lake lit lea
AABB
the peopled fold thy kindly care have found
the horned bull , tremendous , spurns the ground
the lordly lion has enough and more
the forest trembles at his very roar
AABB
thou giv'st the ass his hide , the snail his shell
the puny wasp , victorious , guards his cell
thy minions , kings defend , controul devour
in all th ’ omnipotence of rule and power
AABB
foxes and statesmen subtle wiles ensure
the cit and polecat stink , and are secure
toads with their poison , doctors with their drug
the priest and hedgehog , in their robes , are snug
AABB
keep love for youth , and violets for the spring
or if these bloom when worn out autumn grieves
let them lie hid in double shade of leaves
their own , and others dropped down withering
ABBA
for violets suit when home birds build and sing
not when the outbound bird a passage cleaves
not with dry stubble of mown harvest sheaves
but when the green world buds to blossoming
ABBA
keep violets for the spring , and love for youth
love that should dwell with beauty , mirth , and hope
or if a later sadder love be born
let this not look for grace beyond its scope
ABAB
so late in autumn half the world 's asleep
and half the wakeful world looks pinched and pale
for dampness now , not freshness , rides the gale
and cold and colorless comes ashore the deep
ABBA
with tides that bluster or with tides that creep
now veiled uncouthness wears an uncouth veil
of fog , not sultry haze ; and blight and bale
have done their worst , and leaves rot on the heap
ABBA
so late in autumn one forgets the spring
forgets the summer with its opulence
the callow birds that long have found a wing
the swallows that more lately gat them hence
ABAB
“ there tantalus along the stygian bounds
pours out deep groans ( with groans all hell resounds
e'en in the circling floods refreshment craves
and pines with thirst amidst a sea of waves
AABB
when to the water he his lip applies
back from his lip the treacherous water flies
above , beneath , around his hapless head
trees of all kinds delicious fruitage spread
AABB
there figs , sky dyed , a purple hue disclose
green looks the olive , the pomegranate glows
there dangling pears exalting scents unfold
and yellow apples ripen into gold
AABB
more then most faire , full of the living fire
kindled above unto the maker nere
no eies , but ioyes , in which al powers conspire
that to the world naught else be counted deare
ABAB
thrugh your bright beams doth not the blinded guest
shoot out his darts to base affections wound
but angels come , to lead fraile mindes to rest
in chast desires , on heavenly beauty bound
ABAB
you frame my thoughts , and fashion me within
you stop my toung , and teach my hart to speake
you calme the storme that passion did begin
strong thrugh your cause , but by your vertue weak
ABAB
dares he behold the thing he is , what thing
he would become is in his mind its child
astir , demanding birth to light and wing
for battle prompt , by pleasure unbeguiled
ABAB
so moves he forth in faith , if he has made
his mind god 's temple , dedicate to truth
earth 's nourishing delights , no more gainsaid
he tastes , as doth the bridegroom rich in youth
ABAB
then knows he love , that beckons and controls
the star of sky upon his footway cast
then match in him who holds his tempters fast
the body 's love and mind 's , whereof the soul 's
ABBA
thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all love 's loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
ABAB
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
as interest of the dead , which now appear
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
ABAB
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many , now is thine alone
ABAB
inglorious friend ! most confident i am
thy life is one of very little ease
albeit men mock thee with their similes
and prate of being “ happy as a clam
ABBA
what though thy shell protects thy fragile head
from the sharp bailiffs of the briny sea
thy valves are , sure , no safety valves to thee
while rakes are free to desecrate thy bed
ABBA
and bear thee off — as foemen take their spoil
far from thy friends and family to roam
forced , like a hessian , from thy native home
to meet destruction in a foreign broil
ABBA
look how the pale queen of the silent night
doth cause the ocean to attend upon her
and he , as long as she is in his sight
with his full tide is ready her to honor
ABAB
so you that are the sovereign of my heart
have all my joys attending on your will
my joys low ebbing when you do depart
when you return , their tide my heart doth fill
ABAB
all night i wrestled with a memory
which knocked insurgent at the gates of thought
the crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought
its disillusion ; now i only cry
ABBA
for peace , for power to forget the lie
which hope too long has whispered . so i sought
the sleep which would not come , and night was fraught
with old emotions weeping silently
ABBA
i heard your voice again , and knew the things
which you had promised proved an empty vaunt
i felt your clinging hands while night 's broad wings
cherished our love in darkness . from the lawn
ABAB
“ as ever on this side the boiling wave
thou seest diminishing , ” the centaur said
“ so on the other , be thou well assur 'd
it lower still and lower sinks its bed
ABAB
the wise do send their hearts before them to
dear bless é d heaven , despite the veil between
the foolish nurse their hearts within the screen
of this familiar world , where all we do
ABBA
or have is old , for there is nothing new
yet elder far that world we have not seen
god 's presence antedates what else hath been
many the foolish seem , the wise seem few
ABBA
oh foolishest fond folly of a heart
divided , neither here nor there at rest
that hankers after heaven , but clings to earth
that neither here nor there knows thorough mirth
AABB
“ the lion king forgets his savage pride
and courts with playful paws his tawny bride
the listening tiger hears with kindling flame
the love lorn night call of his brinded dame
AABB
despotic love dissolves the bestial war
bends their proud necks , and joins them to his car
shakes o'er the obedient pairs his silken thong
and goads the humble , or restrains the strong
AABB
slow roll the silver wheels ,— in beauty 's pride
celestial psyche blushing by his side
the lordly bull behind and warrior horse
with voice of thunder shake the echoing course
AABB
how can i woo you in this ancient suit
you do not notice it , of course ; i know it
my soul is burdened with a shapeless boot
your heart is singing welcome to your poet
ABAB
here in the shadowy settle i can sit
and sparkle with you , brightly confidential
but when into the lamp bright zone you flit
i shrink into some corner penitential
ABAB
a well dressed crowd , their tailors all unpaid
throng round you there , and cuffs and collars glisten
of pity 's blindness , as of scorn , afraid
i shun the merry fray , and darkling listen
ABAB
“ a just reproof , ye peers ! your rage restrain
from the protected guest , and menial train
and , prince ! to stop the source of future ill
assent yourself , and gain the royal will
AABB
whilst hope prevail 'd to see your sire restored
of right the queen refused a second lord
but who so vain of faith , so blind to fate
to think he still survives to claim the state
AABB
his fancy paints their distant paths so gay
that childish fortitude awhile gives way
he feels his dreadful loss — yet short the pain
soon he resumes his cheerfulness again
AABB
pond'ring how best his moments to employ
he sings his little songs of nameless joy
creeps on the warm green turf for many an hour
and plucks by chance the white and yellow flow'r
AABB
smoothing their stems , while resting on his knees
he binds a nosegay which he never sees
along the homeward path then feels his way
lifting his brow against the shining day
AABB
o spring , that flutter'st the slow winter by
to drop thy buds before his frosty feet
dost thou not grieve to see thy darlings lie
in trodden death , and weep their beauty sweet
ABAB
yet must thou cast thy tender offering
and make thy way above thy mourn è d dead
or frowning winter would be always king
and thou wouldst never walk with crown è d head
ABAB
so gentle love must make his venturous way
among the shaken buds of his own pain
and many a hope blown garland meekly lay
before the chilly season of disdain
ABAB
that time of life thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruin 'd choirs , where late the sweet birds sang
ABAB
in me thou see'st the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west
which by and by black night doth take away
death 's second self , that seals up all in rest
ABAB
in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the death bed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourished by
ABAB
within my hart , though hardly it can shew
thing so divine to vew of earthly eye
the fayre idea of your celestiall hew
and every part remaines immortally
ABAB
roused though it be full often to a mood
which spurns the check of salutary bands
that this most famous stream in bogs and sands
should perish , and to evil and to good
ABBA
be lost forever . in our halls is hung
armoury of the invincible knights of old
we must be free or die , who speak the tongue
that shakespeare spake ; the faith and morals hold
ABAB
milton ! i think thy spirit hath passed away
from these white cliffs and high embattled towers
this gorgeous fiery coloured world of ours
seems fallen into ashes dull and grey
ABBA
and the age changed unto a mimic play
wherein we waste our else too crowded hours
for all our pomp and pageantry and powers
we are but fit to delve the common clay
ABBA
seeing this little isle on which we stand
this england , this sea lion of the sea
by ignorant demagogues is held in fee
who love her not : dear god ! is this the land
ABBA
ser federigo thought not of the chase
the tender vision of her lovely face
i will not say he seems to see , he sees
in the leaf shadows of the trellises
AABB
herself , yet not herself ; a lovely child
with flowing tresses , and eyes wide and wild
coming undaunted up the garden walk
and looking not at him , but at the hawk
AABB
“ beautiful falcon ! ” said he , “ would that i
might hold thee on my wrist , or see thee fly
the voice was hers , and made strange echoes start
through all the haunted chambers of his heart
AABB
from beauteous windsor 's high and storied halls
where edward 's chiefs start from the glowing walls
to my low cot , from ivory beds of state
pleased i return , unenvious of the great
AABB
so the bee ranges o'er the varied scenes
of corn , of heaths , of fallows , and of greens
pervades the thicket , soars above the hill
or murmurs to the meadow 's murmuring rill
AABB
now haunts old hollowed oaks , deserted cells
now seeks the low vale lily 's silver bells
sips the warm fragrance of the greenhouse bowers
and tastes the myrtle and the citron flowers
AABB
“ the barley harvest was nodding white
when my children died on the rocky height
and the reapers were singing on hill and plain
when i came to my task of sorrow and pain
AABB
but now the season of rain is nigh
the sun is dim in the thickening sky
and the clouds in sullen darkness rest
where he hides his light at the doors of the west
AABB
i hear the howl of the wind that brings
the long drear storm on its heavy wings
but the howling wind and the driving rain
will beat on my houseless head in vain
AABB
if his stately mother knew what i know
as she weeping stood by his side this morning
would she clasp me in motherly love and woe
or drive me out in the cold with scorning
ABAB
if she knew that i loved him better than life
better than death ; since for him i gave
my hopes of rest , that i faced life 's strife
and renounced the quiet and restful grave
ABAB
when his strong , true hand drew me back that day
when woe , and want , and the want of pity
drove me down where the cold waves lay
like wolves round the walls of this cruel city
ABAB
men may pursue the beautiful , while they
love not the good , the life of all the fair
keen eyed for beauty , they will find it where
the darkness of their eyes hath power to slay
ABBA
the vision of the good in beauty 's ray
though fruits the same life giving branches bear
so in a statue they will see the rare
beauty of thought moulded of dull crude clay
ABBA
while loving joys nor prayer their souls expand
so thou didst mould thy thoughts in life not art
teaching with human voice , and eye , and hand
that none the beauty from the truth might part
ABAB
come back to me , who wait and watch for you
or come not yet , for it is over then
and long it is before you come again
so far between my pleasures are and few
ABBA
while , when you come not , what i do i do
thinking “ now when he comes , ” my sweetest “ when
for one man is my world of all the men
this wide world holds ; o love , my world is you
ABBA
howbeit , to meet you grows almost a pang
because the pang of parting comes so soon
my hope hangs waning , waxing , like a moon
between the heavenly days on which we meet
ABBA
“ e'en on the day when youth with beauty wed
the flames surprized them in their nuptial bed
435 seen at the opening sash with bosom bare
with wringing hands , and dark dishevel 'd hair
AABB
the blushing beauty with disorder 'd charms
round her fond lover winds her ivory arms
beat , as they clasp , their throbbing hearts with fear
440 and many a kiss is mix 'd with many a tear
AABB
ah me ! in vain the labouring engines pour
round their pale limbs the ineffectual shower
— then crash 'd the floor , while shrinking crouds retire
and love and virtue sunk amid the fire
AABB
the lights are high on beacon and from bower
and ‘ midst them conrad seeks medora 's tower
he looks in vain — ‘ tis strange — and all remark
amid so many , hers alone is dark
AABB
‘ tis strange — of yore its welcome never failed
nor now , perchance , extinguished — only veiled
with the first boat descends he for the shore
and looks impatient on the lingering oar
AABB
oh ! for a wing beyond the falcon 's flight
to bear him like an arrow to that height
with the first pause the resting rowers gave
he waits not — looks not — leaps into the wave
AABB
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thy self thy beauty 's legacy
nature 's bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
ABAB
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
ABAB
for having traffic with thy self alone
thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
ABAB
all that which aegypt whilome did devise
all that which greece their temples to embrave
after th'ionicke , atticke , doricke guise
or corinth skil 'd in curious workes to grave
ABAB
all that lysippus practike * arte could forme
apelles wit , or phidias his skill
was wont this auncient citie to adorne
and the heaven it selfe with her wide wonders fill
ABAB
all that which athens ever brought forth wise
all that which afrike ever brought forth strange
all that which asie ever had of prise
was here to see . o mervelous great change
ABAB
unhappy pen , and ill accepted lines
that intimate in vain my chaste desire
my chaste desire , which from dark sorrow shines
enkindled by her eyes ’ celestial fire
ABAB
celestial fire , and unrespecting powers
which pity not the wounds made by their might
showed in these lines , the work of careful hours
the sacrifice here offered to her sight
ABAB
but since she weighs them not , this rests for me
i 'll moan myself , and hide the wrong i have
and so content me that her frowns should be
to m'infant style the cradle and the grave
ABAB
so if thou hadst been scorned in human eyes
too bright and near to be a glory then
if as truth 's artist , thou hadst been to men
a setter forth of strange divinities
ABBA
to after times , thou , born in midday skies
a sun , high up , out blazing sudden , when
its light had had its centuries eight and ten
to travel through the wretched void that lies
ABBA
‘ twixt souls and truth , hadst been a love and fear
worshipped on high from magian 's mountain crest
and all night long symbol 'd by lamp flames clear
thy sign , a star upon thy people 's breast
ABAB
when from the prison of its body free
my soul shall soar , before it goes to thee
thou great creator , give it power to know
the language of all sad , dumb things below
AABB
and let me dwell a season still on earth
before i rise to some diviner birth
invisible to men , yet seen and heard
and understood by sorrowing beast and bird
AABB
invisible to men , yet always near
to whisper counsel in the human ear
and with a spell to stay the hunter 's hand
and stir his heart to know and understand
AABB
england ! the time is come when thou shouldst wean
thy heart from its emasculating food
the truth should now be better understood
old things have been unsettled ; we have seen
ABBA
england ! all nations in this charge agree
but worse , more ignorant in love and hate
far , far more abject is thine enemy
therefore the wise pray for thee , though the freight
ABAB
patience , long sick to death , is dead . too long
have sloth and doubt and treason bidden us be
what cromwell 's england was not , when the sea
to him bore witness given of blake how strong
ABBA
she stood , a commonweal that brooked no wrong
from foes less vile than men like wolves set free
whose war is waged where none may fight or flee
with women and with weanlings . speech and song
ABBA
lack utterance now for loathing . scarce we hear
foul tongues that blacken god 's dishonoured name
with prayers turned curses and with praise found shame
defy the truth whose witness now draws near
ABBA
go , wailing verse , the infants of my love
minerva like , brought forth without a mother
present the image of the cares i prove
witness your father 's grief exceeds all other
ABAB
sigh out a story of her cruel deeds
with interrupted accents of despair
a monument that whosoever reads
may justly praise and blame my loveless fair
ABAB
say her disdain hath dri è d up my blood
and starv è d you , in succours still denying
press to her eyes , importune me some good
waken her sleeping pity with your crying
ABAB
a face seen passing in a crowded street
a voice heard singing music , large and free
and from that moment life is changed , and we
become of more heroic temper , meet
ABBA
to freely ask and give , a man complete
radiant because of faith , we dare to be
what nature meant us . brave idolatry
which can conceive a hero ! no deceit
ABBA
no knowledge taught by unrelenting years
can quench this fierce , untamable desire
we know that what we long for once achieved
will cease to satisfy . be still our fears
ABBA
you think me quite as good as other men
nay , more , i think you think me vastly better
your candid glances seem to ask me when
i 'll seek to bind you in a willing fetter
ABAB
is this presumption ? not from friend to friend
whose souls unite like clasping hands of lovers
yet can i breathe no word of love , to end
the delicate doubt that o'er the unspoken hovers
ABAB
if i were hopeless that you loved me not
my hopeless love , confess 'd , myself would flatter
but should the blissful dream be true , i wot
that love confess 'd the joy of love would shatter
ABAB
the prateling nests meane while no silence keep
their wandring guests ne ’ re sleep
to ’ s mate , the turtle ’ mong ’ st the branches grones
and with complaints breakes hardest stones
AABB
the kingly bird that beares ioves thunder clap
one day did scorne the simple scarabee
proud of his highest service and good hap
that made all other foules his thralls to bee
ABAB
the silly flie , that no redresse did see
spide where the eagle built his towring nest
and , kindling fire within the hollow tree
burnt up his yong ones , and himselfe distrest
ABAB
ne suffred him in anie place to rest
but drove in ioves owne lap his egs to lay
where gathering also filth him to infest
forst with the filth his egs to fling away
ABAB
cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
a maid of dian 's this advantage found
and his love kindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valley fountain of that ground
ABAB
which borrowed from this holy fire of love
a dateless lively heat still to endure
and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
against strange maladies a sovereign cure
ABAB
but at my mistress ’ eye love 's brand new fired
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast
i sick withal the help of bath desired
and thither hied a sad distempered guest
ABAB
whenas my licia sail è d in the seas
viewing with pride god neptune 's stately crown
a calm she made , and brought the merchant ease
the storm she stayed , and checked him with a frown
ABAB
love at the stern sate smiling and did sing
to see how seas had learned for to obey
and balls of fire into the waves did fling
and still the boy full wanton thus did say
ABAB
“ both poles we burnt whereon the world doth turn
the round of heaven from earth unto the skies
and now the seas we both intend to burn
i with my bow , and licia with her eyes
ABAB
it is the tread of armies marching near
from scarlet lands to lands forever pale
it is a bugle dying down the gale
it is the sudden gushing of a tear
ABBA
and it is hands that grope at ghostly doors
and romp of spirit children on the pave
it is the tender sighing of the brave
who fell , ah ! long ago , in futile wars
ABBA
the shepherd on his journey heard when nigh
his dog among the bushes barking high
the ploughman ran and gave a hearty shout
he found a weary fox and beat him out
AABB
the ploughman laughed and would have ploughed him in
but the old shepherd took him for the skin
he lay upon the furrow stretched for dead
the old dog lay and licked the wounds that bled
AABB
the ploughman beat him till his ribs would crack
and then the shepherd slung him at his back
and when he rested , to his dog 's surprise
the old fox started from his dead disguise
AABB
i feel myself endangered beyond reason
my death already ‘ twixt the cup and lip
because my proud desire through curs è d treason
would make my hopes mount heaven , which cannot skip
ABAB
my fancy still requireth at my hands
such things as are not , cannot , may not be
and my desire although my power withstands
will give me wings , who never yet could flee
ABAB
what then remains except my maim è d soul
extort compassion from love flying age
or if naught else their fury may control
to call on death that quells affection 's rage
ABAB
‘ twas on the morn ’ when heaven its blessed ray
in pity to its suffering master veil 'd
first did i , lady , to your beauty yield
of your victorious eyes th ’ unguarded prey
ABBA
ah ! little reck 'd i that , on such a day
needed against love 's arrows any shield
and trod ’ securely trod , the fatal field
whence , with the world 's , began my heart 's dismay
ABBA
on every side love found his victim bare
and through mine eyes transfix 'd my throbbing heart
those eyes , which now with constant sorrows flow
but poor the triumph of his boasted art
ABAB
dear heart and love ! what happiness to sit
and watch the firelight 's varying shade and shine
on thy young face ; and through those eyes of thine
as through glad windows — mark fair fancies flit
ABBA
in sumptuous chambers of thy soul 's chaste wit
like graceful women : then to take in mine
thy hand , whose pressure brims my heart 's divine
hushed rapture as with music exquisite
ABBA
when i remember how thy look and touch
sway , like the moon , my blood with ecstasy
i dare not think to what fierce heaven might lead
thy soft embrace ; or in thy kiss how much
ABBA
above , the sire of gods his thunder rolls
and peals on peals redoubled rend the poles
beneath , stern neptune shakes the solid ground
the forests wave , the mountains nod around
AABB
through all their summits tremble ida ’ s woods
and from their sources boil her hundred floods
troy ’ s turrets totter on the rocking plain
and the toss ’ d navies beat the heaving main
AABB
deep in the dismal regions of the dead
the infernal monarch rear ’ d his horrid head
leap ’ d from his throne , lest neptune ’ s arm should lay
his dark dominions open to the day
AABB
o call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
use power with power , and slay me not by art
ABAB
tell me thou lov'st elsewhere ; but in my sight
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide
ABAB
let me excuse thee , ah my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
and therefore from my face she turns my foes
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries
ABAB
ah ! who can e'er forget so fair a being
who can forget her half retiring sweets
god ! she is like a milk white lamb that bleats
for man 's protection . surely the all seeing
ABBA
who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing
will never give him pinions , who intreats
such innocence to ruin ,— who vilely cheats
a dove like bosom . in truth there is no freeing
ABBA
one 's thoughts from such a beauty ; when i hear
a lay that once i saw her hand awake
her form seems floating palpable , and near
had i e'er seen her from an arbour take
ABAB
if thou hadst been a poet ! on my heart
the thought dashed . it recoiled , as , with the gift
light blinded , and joy saddened , so bereft
and the hot fountain tears , with sudden start
ABBA
thronged to mine eyes , as if with that same smart
the husk of vision had in twain been cleft
its hidden soul in naked beauty left
and we beheld thee , nature , as thou art
ABBA
o poet , poet , poet ! at thy feet
i should have lien , sainted with listening
my pulses answering aye , in rhythmic beat
each parting word that with melodious wing
ABAB
guido , i would that lapo , thou , and i
led by some strong enchantment , might ascend
a magic ship , whose charmed sails should fly
with winds at will where'er our thoughts might wend
ABAB
so that no change , nor any evil chance
should mar our joyous voyage ; but it might be
that even satiety should still enhance
between our hearts their strict community
ABAB
and that the bounteous wizard then would place
vanna and bice and my gentle love
companions of our wandering , and would grace
with passionate talk , wherever we might rove
ABAB
where , when that soverayne beauty it doth spy
resembling heavens glory in her light
drawn with sweet pleasures bayt it back doth fly
and unto heaven forgets her former flight
ABAB
there my fraile fancy , fed with full delight
doth bathe in blisse , and mantlcth most at ease
ne thinks of other heaven , but how it might
her harts desire with most contentment please
ABAB
for shelter here , to shun the noonday heat
an airy nation of the flies retreat
some in soft air their silken pinions ply
and some from bough to bough delighted fly
AABB
some rise , and circling light to perch again
a pleasing murmur hums along the plain
so , when a stage invites to pageant shows
( if great and small are like ) appear the beaux
AABB
in boxes some with spruce pretension sit
some change from seat to seat within the pit
some roam the scenes , or turning cease to roam
preluding music fills the lofty dome
AABB
impelled by feelings in their nature kind
but slightly weak and somewhat undefined
rush at each other , make a sudden stand
begin to talk , expatiate , and expand
AABB
each looks quite radiant , seems extremely struck
their meeting so was such a piece of luck
each thinks the other thinks he ‘ s greatly pleased
to screw the vice in which they both are squeezed
AABB
so there they talk , in dust , or mud , or snow
both bored to death , and both afraid to go
your hat once lifted , do not hang your fire
nor , like slow ajax , fighting still , retire
AABB
as a bad orator , badly o ’ er book skilled
doth overflow his purpose with made heat
and , like a clock , winds with withoutness willed
what should have been an inner instinct ’ s feat
ABAB
or as a prose wit , harshly poet turned
lacking the subtler music in his measure
with useless care labours but to be spurned
courting in alien speech the muse ’ s pleasure
ABAB
i study how to love or how to hate
estranged by consciousness from sentiment
with a thought feeling forced to be sedate
even when the feeling ’ s nature is violent
ABAB
lanval ! ‘ tis told , had pass 'd from foreign strand
and kinsmen none there dwelt on english land
and well he knew that in the hour of proof
friends for the most part fail , and stand aloof
AABB
lawrence , what though the world be growing dark
and twilight cool thy potent day inclose
the sun , beneath the round earth sunk , still glows
all the night through , sleepless and young and stark
ABBA
oh , be thy spirit faithful as the lark
more daring : in the midnight of thy woes
dart through them , higher than earth 's shadow goes
into the light of which thou art a spark
ABBA
be willing to be blind — that , in thy night
the lord may bring his father to thy door
and enter in , and feast thy soul with light
then shall thou dream of darksome ways no more
ABAB
one gazed steadfast into the dying west
with lips apart to greet the evening star
and one with eyes that caught the strife and jar
of the sea 's heart , followed the sunward breast
ABBA
of a lone gull ; from a slow harp one drew
blind music like a laugh or like a wail
and in the uncertain shadow of the sail
one wove a crown of berries and of yew
ABBA
yet even as i said with dull desire
“ all these were mine , and one was mine indeed
the smoky music burst into a fire
and i was left alone in my great need
ABAB
among the ruffians that , allured by gain
lurk 'd round the dwellings of the royal dane
the horrid eminence a swede might claim
a lawless wretch — olaus was his name
AABB
and twice in battle drawn his venal sword
against a generous and forgiving lord
successive crimes o'er nature soon prevail 'd
and denmark 's king the perfect villain hail 'd
AABB
these words the poet heard in paradise
uttered by one who , bravely dying here
in the true faith was living in that sphere
where the celestial cross of sacrifice
ABBA
spread its protecting arms athwart the skies
and set thereon , like jewels crystal clear
the souls magnanimous , that knew not fear
flashed their effulgence on his dazzled eyes
ABBA
and thou , my village ! as again i tread
amidst thy living and above thy dead
though some fair playmates guard with charter fears
their cheeks , grown holy with the lapse of years
AABB
though with the dust some reverend locks may blend
where life 's last mile stone marks the journey 's end
on every bud the changing year recalls
the brightening glance of morning memory falls
AABB
still following onward as the months unclose
the balmy lilac or the bridal rose
and still shall follow , till they sink once more
beneath the snow drifts of the frozen shore
AABB
“ now through the rocks , appall 'd with deep dismay
we bend our course , and stem the desperate way
dire scylla there a scene of horror forms
and here charybdis fills the deep with storms
AABB
when the tide rushes from her rumbling caves
the rough rock roars , tumultuous boil the waves
they toss , they foam , a wild confusion raise
like waters bubbling o'er the fiery blaze
AABB
eternal mists obscure the aerial plain
and high above the rock she spouts the main
when in her gulfs the rushing sea subsides
she drains the ocean with the refluent tides
AABB
“ fair truth alone ( the patient man replied
my words shall dictate , and my lips shall guide
to him , to me , one common lot was given
in equal woes , alas ! involved by heaven
AABB
much of his fates i know ; but check 'd by fear
i stand ; the hand of violence is here
here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade
and injured suppliants seek in vain for aid
AABB
let for a space the pensive queen attend
nor claim my story till the sun descend
then in such robes as suppliants may require
composed and cheerful by the genial fire
AABB
be nought dismayd that her unmoved mind
doth still persist in her rebellious pride
such love , not lyke to lusts of baser kynd
the harder wonne , the firmer will abide
ABAB
so hard it is to kindle new desire
in gentle brest , that shall endure for ever
deepe is the wound that dints the parts entire
with chaste affects , that naught but death can sever
ABAB
poor rod'rick now no other hope had got
than what the chance of traffick might allot
illusion vain , or doubtful at the best
though some grow rich , yet all are not so blessed
AABB
‘ twas said our husband never would succeed
and truly , such it seemed to be decreed
his agents ( similar to those we see
in modern days ) were with his treasure free
AABB
his ships were wrecked ; his commerce came to naught
deceived by knaves , of whom he well had thought
obliged to borrow money , which to pay
he was unable at th ’ appointed day
AABB
the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts
and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts
at this the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook
a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look
AABB
she sees , and trembles at th ’ approaching ill
just in the jaws of ruin , and codille
and now ( as oft in some distempered state
on one nice trick depends the general fate
AABB
an ace of hearts steps forth ; the king unseen
lurked in her hand , and mourned his captive queen
he springs to vengeance with an eager pace
and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace
AABB
but tyrant sickness fed upon my love
and spread his ensigns , dyed with colour white
then was suspicion glad for to remove
and loving much did fear to lose her quite
ABAB
erect , fair sweet , the colors thou didst wear
dislodge thy griefs ; the short'ners of content
for now of life , not love , is all my fear
lest life and love be both together spent
ABAB
ere greece soared , showering sovranties of light
ere rome shook earth with her tremendous tread
ere yon blue feasting sun god burst blood red
beneath thee slept thy prodigy , o night
ABBA
aeons have ta'en like dreams their strange , slow flight
and vastest , tiniest , creatures paved her bed
e'en cities sapped by the usurping spread
of her imperious waves have sunk from sight
ABBA
on other shores , above their mouldering towns
in sullen pomp the tall cathedral frowns
pride in its aisles and paupers at the door
which feeds the beggars whom it fleeced of yore
AABB
simple and frail , our lowly temples throw
their slender shadows on the paths below
scarce steal the winds , that sweep his woodland tracks
the larch 's perfume from the settler 's axe
AABB
ere , like a vision of the morning air
his slight — framed steeple marks the house of prayer
its planks all reeking and its paint undried
its rafters sprouting on the shady side
AABB
has she forgotten ? on this very may
we were to meet here , with the birds and bees
as on that sabbath , underneath the trees
we strayed among the tombs , and stripped away
ABBA
the vines from these old granites , cold and gray
and yet indeed not grim enough were they
to stay our kisses , smiles and ecstasies
or closer voice lost vows and rhapsodies
AABB
has she forgotten — that the may has won
its promise ?— that the bird songs from the tree
are sprayed above the grasses as the sun
might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly
ABAB
what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears to hopes , and hopes to fears
still losing when i saw my self to win
ABAB
o benefit of ill , now i find true
that better is , by evil still made better
and ruined love when it is built anew
grows fairer than at first , more strong , far greater
ABAB
or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
drink up the monarch 's plague this flattery
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true
and that your love taught it this alchemy
ABAB
to make of monsters , and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble
ABAB
o ‘ tis the first , ‘ tis flattery in my seeing
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up
mine eye well knows what with his gust is ‘ greeing
and to his palate doth prepare the cup
ABAB
have they not in the north sea 's blast
bowed to the waves the straining mast
their frozen sails the low , pale sun
of thule 's night has shone upon
AABB
flapped by the sea wind 's gusty sweep
round icy drift , and headland steep
wild jutland 's wives and lochlin 's daughters
have watched them fading o'er the waters
AABB
were this to happen now , scamander 's stream
would not so easily preserve esteem
but crimes like these ( whoever was abused
in former days , were easily excused
AABB
with time our maxims change , and what was then
though wrong at present , may prevail agen
scamander 's spouse some raillery received
but in the end she fully was relieved
AABB
a lover e'en superior thought her charms
( his taste was such ) and took her to his arms
the gods can nothing spoil ! but should they cause
a belle to lose a portion of applause
AABB
thus mourn 'd the hapless man : a thundering sound
roll 'd thro the shuddering walls and shook the ground
o'er all the dungeon , where black arches bend
the roofs unfold , and streams of light descend
AABB
the growing splendor fills the astonish 'd room
and gales etherial breathe a glad perfume
robed in the radiance , moves a form serene
of human structure , but of heavenly mien
AABB
near to the prisoner 's couch he takes his stand
and waves , in sign of peace , his holy hand
tall rose his stature , youth 's endearing grace
adorn 'd his limbs and brighten 'd in his face
AABB
thought was born blind , but thought knows what is seeing
its careful touch , deciphering forms from shapes
still suggests form as aught whose proper being
mere finding touch with erring darkness drapes
ABAB
yet whence , except from guessed sight , does touch teach
that touch is but a close and empty sense
how does mere touch , self uncontented , reach
for some truer sense ’ s whole intelligence
ABAB
the thing once touched , if touch be now omitted
stands yet in memory real and outward known
so the untouching memory of touch is fitted
with sense of a sense whereby far things are shown
ABAB
as an old mercer in some sleepy town
swings wide his windows new day after day
sets all his wares around in arch array
to please the taste of passers up and down
ABBA
his hoard of handy things of trite renown
of sweets and spices and of faint perfumes
of silks and prints ,— and at the last illumes
his tiny panes to foil the evening 's frown
ABBA
so nature spreads her proffered treasures : such
as daily dazzle at the morning 's rise
fair show of isle and ocean merchandise
and airy offerings filmy to the touch
ABBA
thou cam'st not to thy place by accident
it is the very place god meant for thee
and shouldst thou there small scope for action see
do not for this give room to discontent
ABBA
nor let the time thou owest god be spent
in idle dreaming how thou mightest be
in what concerns thy spiritual life , more free
from outward hindrance or impediment
ABBA
for presently this hindrance thou shalt find
that without which all goodness were a task
so slight that virtue never could grow strong
and wouldst thou do one duty to his mind
ABBA
thou yellow trumpeter of laggard spring
thou herald of rich summer 's myriad flowers
the climbing sun with new recovered powers
does warm thee into being , through the ring
ABBA
of rich , brown earth he woos thee , makes thee fling
thy green shoots up , inheriting the dowers
of bending sky and sudden , sweeping showers
till ripe and blossoming thou art a thing
ABBA
to make all nature glad , thou art so gay
to fill the lonely with a joy untold
nodding at every gust of wind to day
to morrow jewelled with raindrops . always bold
ABAB
when in the widening circle of rebirth
to a new flesh my travelled soul shall come
and try again the unremembered earth
with the old sadness for the immortal home
ABAB
shall i revisit these same differing fields
and cull the old new flowers with the same sense
that some small breath of foiled remembrance yields
of more age than my days in this pretence
ABAB
shall i again regret strange faces lost
of which the present memory is forgot
and but in unseen bulks of vagueness tossed
out of the closed sea and black night of thought
ABAB
come time , the anchor hold of my desire
my last resort whereto my hopes appeal
cause once the date of her disdain t'exspire
make her the sentence of her wrath repeal
ABAB
rob her fair brow , break in on beauty , steal
power from those eyes which pity cannot spare
deal with those dainty cheeks , as she doth deal
with this poor heart consum è d with despair
ABAB
this heart made now the pr ò spective of care
by loving her , the cruelst fair that lives
the cruelst fair that sees i pine for her
and never mercy to thy merit gives
ABAB
with all the fairest angels nearest god
the ineffable true of heart around the throne
there shall i find you waiting when the flown
dream leaves my heart insentient as the clod
ABBA
and when the grief retracing ways i trod
become a shining path to thee alone
my weary feet , that seemed to drag as stone
shall once again , with wings of fleetness shod
ABBA
fare on , beloved , to find you ! just beyond
the seraph throng await me , standing near
the gentler angels , eager and apart
be there , near god 's own fairest , with the fond
ABBA
vi . “ but yet the great of soul have ever been
the first to glory in all works of art
for from the genius form would ever dart
a light of inspiration , and a sheen
ABBA
as of new comings ; and ourselves have seen
men of stern purpose to whose eyes would start
sorrow at sight of sorrow though no heart
did riot underneath that chilly , screen
ABBA
and hence we judge such utterance native to
the human soul — expression highest — best
— nay , it is by such sign they will pursue
albeit unknowing , beauty , without rest
ABAB
ye heavens regard ! almighty jove look down
and view thy injured monarch on the throne
on their ungrateful heads due vengeance take
who sought his aid , and then his part forsake
AABB
witness , ye powers ! it was our call alone
which now our pride makes us ashamed to own
britannia 's troubles fetch 'd him from afar
to court the dreadful casualties of war
AABB
low in the west , a banner floating wide
of god 's own colors hangs in dreamy pride
a wealth of purple stains and gleams of gold
a crimson splendor o'er each waving fold
AABB
a heap of gold — a rim of amethyst
a hanging cloud by glancing sunbeams kissed
afar upon the tinted , azure skies
a tiny cloud of rosy color lies
AABB
a coral on a velvet robe of blue
a warm , bright wave upon the skies ’ pale hue
oh ! such the sunset sky of italy
the land of dreams , of love and melody
AABB
and laurance stared about him half in doubt
if this were real , for all things were so blithe
and soft air tossed the little flowers about
the child was singing , and the blackbirds piped
ABAB
oft have we trod the vales of castaly
and heard sweet notes of sylvan music blown
from antique reeds to common folk unknown
and often launched our bark upon that sea
ABBA
which the nine muses hold in empery
and ploughed free furrows through the wave and foam
nor spread reluctant sail for more safe home
till we had freighted well our argosy
ABBA
but thou ( since nature bids ) the world resign
‘ tis now thy daughter 's daughter 's time to shine
with more address , ( or such as pleases more
she runs her female exercises o'er
AABB
unfurls or closes , raps or turns the fan
and smiles , or blushes at the creature man
with quicker life , as gilded coaches pass
in sideling courtesy she drops the glass
AABB
with better strength , on visit days she bears
to mount her fifty flights of ample stairs
her mien , her shape , her temper , eyes and tongue
are sure to conquer — for the rogue is young
AABB
the peasant ‘ gan to turn things in his mind
said he , to take the heads i 'm not inclined
no drink , you say , between ; that makes it worse
to eat the garlick thus , would prove a curse
AABB
nor can i suffer on my tender back
that , with a cudgel , thirty blows you thwack
still harder thirty pounds to pay appeared
uncertain how to act , he hanging feared
AABB
the noble peer he begged , upon his knees
his penitence to hear , and sentence ease
but mercy dwelled not with the angry lord
is this , cried he , the answer ?— bring a cord
AABB
o how thy worth with manners may i sing
when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what is't but mine own when i praise thee
ABAB
even for this , let us divided live
and our dear love lose name of single one
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deserv'st alone
ABAB
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
ABAB
sir , if my unpolish't pen , that dedicates new
the bashfull utterance of a maiden muse
may gracefully arrive onely to you
which for her virgin sake , do not refuse
ABAB
the poets say , the gods that can command
haue feasted gladly on a poore mans store
whereby great sir , we haue to understand
that humble riuers adde to the seashore
ABAB
“ tweet ” pipes the robin as the cat creeps by
her nestling young that in the elderns lie
and then the bluecap tootles in its glee
picking the flies from orchard apple tree
AABB
around the rotten tree the firetail mourns
as the old hedger to his toil returns
chopping the grain to stop the gap close by
the hole where her blue eggs in safety lie
AABB
“ fair sir gan , ” the emperor spake
“ this my message to marsil take
he shall make confession of christ 's belief
and i yield him , full half of spain in fief
AABB
in the other half shall count roland reign
if he choose not the terms i now ordain
i will march unto saragossa 's gate
besiege and capture the city straight
AABB
take and bind him both hands and feet
lead him to aix , to my royal seat
there to be tried and judged and slain
dying a death of disgrace and pain
AABB
the mountains in their overwhelming might
moved me to sadness when i saw them first
and afterwards they moved me to delight
struck harmonies from silent chords which burst
ABAB
out into song , a song by memory nursed
forever unrenewed by touch or sight
sleeps the keen magic of each day or night
in pleasure and in wonder then immersed
ABBA
all switzerland behind us on the ascent
all italy before us we plunged down
st. gothard , garden of forget me not
yet why should such a flower choose such a spot
AABB
o ye who loved our grandmothers of yore
fitzpatrick , sheridan , and many more
and thou , my prince ! whose sovereign taste and will
it is to love the lovely beldames still
AABB
thou ghost of queensbury ! whose judging sprite
satan may spare to peep a single night
pronounce — if ever in your days of bliss
asmodeus struck so bright a stroke as this
AABB
to teach the young ideas how to rise
flush in the cheek , and languish in the eyes
rush to the heart , and lighten through the frame
with half told wish and ill dissembled flame
AABB
for here the air is horrid with men 's groans
the priests who call upon thy name are slain
dost thou not hear the bitter wail of pain
from those whose children lie upon the stones
ABBA
come down , o son of god ! incestuous gloom
curtains the land , and through the starless night
over thy cross a crescent moon i see
if thou in very truth didst burst the tomb
ABBA
“ next by sensation led , new joys commence
from the fine movements of the excited sense
in swarms ideal urge their airy flight
adorn the day scenes , and illume the night
AABB
her spells o'er all the hand of fancy flings
gives form and substance to unreal things
with fruits and foliage decks the barren waste
and brightens life with sentiment and taste
AABB
pleased o'er the level and the rule presides
the painter 's brush , the sculptor 's chisel guides
with ray ethereal lights the poet 's fire
tunes the rude pipe , or strings the heroic lyre
AABB
i love to see the old heath 's withered brake
mingle its crimpled leaves with furze and ling
while the old heron from the lonely lake
starts slow and flaps his melancholy wing
ABAB
and oddling crow in idle motions swing
on the half rotten ashtree 's topmost twig
beside whose trunk the gipsy makes his bed
up flies the bouncing woodcock from the brig
ABAB
where a black quagmire quakes beneath the tread
the fieldfares chatter in the whistling thorn
and for the awe round fields and closen rove
and coy bumbarrels twenty in a drove
AABB
he faced his canvas ( as a seer whose ken
pierces the crust of this existence through
and smiled beyond on that his genius knew
ere mated with his being . conscious then
ABBA
of his high theme alone , he smiled again
straight back upon himself in many a hue
and tint , and light and shade , which slowly grew
enfeatured of a fair girl 's face , as when
ABBA
first time she smiles for love 's sake with no fear
so wrought he , witless that behind him leant
a woman , with old features , dim and sear
and glamoured eyes that felt the brimming tear
ABAB
if poisonous minerals , and if that tree
whose fruit threw death on ( else immortal ) us
if lecherous goats , if serpents envious
cannot be damn 'd , alas ! why should i be
ABBA
why should intent or reason , born in me
make sins , else equal , in me more heinous
and mercy being easy and glorious
to god , in his stern wrath why threatens he
ABBA
but who am i that dare dispute with thee
o god ! oh , of thine only worthy blood
and my tears , make a heavenly lethean flood
and drown in it my sins ’ black memory
ABBA
dear cymru , mid thy mountains soaring high
dwells genius , basking on thy quiet air
and heavenly shades , and solitude more rare
and all wrapt round with fullest harmony
ABBA
of streams which fall afar . thus pleasantly
‘ neath nature their fit foster mother 's care
thy children learn from infant hours to bear
and work the will of god . thy scenery
ABBA
so varied wild , so strangely sweet and strong
works on them and to music moulds their mind
till flows their fancy in poetic rills
the voice of nature breathes in every song
ABBA
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
lose all , and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet ; forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
ABAB
no , let me be obsequious in thy heart
and take thou my oblation , poor but free
which is not mixed with seconds , knows no art
but mutual render , only me for thee
ABAB
thousands of thousands of hushed years ago
out on the edge of chaos , all alone
i stood on peaks of vapor , high upthrown
above a sea that knew nor ebb nor flow
ABBA
nor any motion won of winds that blow
nor any sound of watery wail or moan
nor lisp of wave , nor wandering undertone
of any tide lost in the night below
ABBA
so still it was , i mind me , as i laid
my thirsty ear against mine own faint sigh
to drink of that , i sipped it , half afraid
‘ twas but the ghost of a dead voice spilled by
ABAB
such prayers last year were put up for thy sake
what shall this year do that hath lived to see
the piteous and unpitied end of thee
what moan , what cry , what clamour shall it make
ABBA
seeing as a reed breaks all thine empire break
and all thy great strength as a rotten tree
whose branches made broad night from sea to sea
and the world shuddered when a leaf would shake
ABBA
from the unknown deep wherein those prayers were heard
from the dark height of time there sounds a word
crying , comfort ; though death ride on this red hour
hope waits with eyes that make the morning dim
AABB
this door you might not open , and you did
so enter now , and see for what slight thing
you are betrayed . . . . here is no treasure hid
no cauldron , no clear crystal mirroring
ABAB
yet this alone out of my life i kept
unto myself , lest any know me quite
and you did so profane me when you crept
unto the threshold of this room to night
ABAB
my reason absent did mine eyes require
to watch and ward and such foes to descry
as they should ne'er my heart approaching spy
but traitor eyes my heart 's death did conspire
ABBA
corrupted with hope 's gifts ; let in desire
to burn my heart ; and sought no remedy
though store of water were in either eye
which well employed , might well have quenched the fire
ABBA
reason return è d ; love and fortune made
judges , to judge mine eyes to punishment
fortune , sith they by sight my heart betrayed
from wish è d sight , adjudged them banishment
ABAB
‘ tis bed time ; say your hymn , and bid “ good night
“ god bless mamma , papa , and dear ones all
your half shut eyes beneath your eye lids fall
another minute you will shut them quite
ABBA
yes , i will carry you , put out the light
and tuck you up , although you are so tall
what will you give me , sleepy one , and call
my wages , if i settle you all right
ABBA
i am so weary with the burden old
of foregone faults , and power of custom base
that much i fear to perish from the ways
and fall into my enemy 's grim fold
ABBA
true , a high friend , to free me , not with gold
came , of ineffable and utmost grace
then straightway vanished from before my face
so that in vain i strive him to behold
ABBA
but his voice yet comes echoing below
o ye that labour , the way open lies
come unto me lest some one shut the gate
— what heavenly grace — what love will — or what fate
AABB
poets did feign that heavens a venus had
matchless herself , and cupid was her son
men sued to these , and of their smiles were glad
by whom so many famous were undone
ABAB
now cupid mourns that he hath lost his might
and that these two so comely are to see
and venus frowns because they have her right
yet both so like that both shall blameless be
ABAB
with heaven 's two twins for godhead these may strive
and rule a world with least part of a frown
fairer than these two twins are not alive
both conquering queens , and both deserve a crown
ABAB
when most i wink then do mine eyes best see
for all the day they view things unrespected
but when i sleep , in dreams they look on thee
and darkly bright , are bright in dark directed
ABAB
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadow 's form , form happy show
to the clear day with thy much clearer light
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
ABAB
how would ( i say ) mine eyes be blessed made
by looking on thee in the living day
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
ABAB
fair grace of graces , muse of muses all
thou paradise , thou only heaven i know
what influence hath bred my hateful woe
that i from thee and them am forced to fall
ABBA
thou falled from me , from thee i never shall
although my fortunes thou hast brought so low
yet shall my faith and service with thee go
for live i do , on heaven and thee to call
ABBA
banish 'd all grace , no graces with me dwell
compelled to muse , my muses from me fly
excluded heaven , what can remain but hell
exiled from paradise , in hate i lie
ABAB
i stand again on the familiar shore
and hear the waves of the distracted sea
piteously calling and lamenting thee
and waiting restless at thy cottage door
ABBA
the rocks , the sea weed on the ocean floor
the willows in the meadow , and the free
wild winds of the atlantic welcome me
then why shouldst thou be dead , and come no more
ABBA
ah , why shouldst thou be dead , when common men
are busy with their trivial affairs
having and holding ? why , when thou hadst read
nature 's mysterious manuscript , and then
ABBA
at last , beloved nature ! i have met
thee face to face upon thy breezy hills
and boldly , where thy inmost bowers are set
gazed on thee naked in thy mountain rills
ABAB
when first i felt thy breath upon my brow
tears of strange ecstasy gushed out like rain
and with a longing , passionate as vain
i strove to clasp thee . but , i know not how
ABBA
always before me didst thou seem to glide
and often from one sunny mountain side
upon the next bright peak i saw thee kneel
and heard thy voice upon the billowy blast
AABB
but who , half sceptic , half afraid of wrong
shall walk our streets , and mark the passing throng
the brawny oaf in mould herculean cast
the pigmy statesman trembling in his blast
AABB
who forms scarce visible shall thus descry
like flitting clouds athwart the mental sky
from giant bodies then bare gleams of mind
like mountain watch lights blinking to the wind
AABB
when i have fears that i may cease to be
before my pen has glean 'd my teeming brain
before high piled books , in charactery
hold like rich garners the full ripen 'd grain
ABAB
when i behold , upon the night 's starr 'd face
huge cloudy symbols of a high romance
and think that i may never live to trace
their shadows , with the magic hand of chance
ABAB
and when i feel , fair creature of an hour
that i shall never look upon thee more
never have relish in the faery power
of unreflecting love ;— then on the shore
ABAB
the old house totters ‘ neath its weight of years
bowed , like the form of him who shelters there
old , friendless , lone — save for the wanton , care
who flouts him , mocks his grief with gibes and jeers
ABBA
and laughs to see his piteous hopes grow fears
not his the joy of placid , sun crowned age
his dim eyes falter as he scans the page
of life 's worn album , blotted with his tears
ABBA
he sees in dreams the wife he loved — long dead
the son — once proud to bear his father 's name
who mixed his honest blood with dire disgrace
the wayward girl who wrought her father shame
ABAB
my grief begun , fair saint , when first i saw
love in those eyes sit ruling with disdain
whose sweet commands did keep a world in awe
and caused them serve your favor to obtain
ABAB
i stood as one enchanted with a frown
yet smiled to see all creatures serve those eyes
where each with sighs paid tribute to that crown
and thought them grac è d by your dumb replies
ABAB
but i , ambitious , could not be content
till that my service more than sighs made known
and for that end my heart to you i sent
to say and swear that , fair , it is your own
ABAB
his house was known to all the vagrant train
he chid their wanderings , but relieved their pain
the long remembered beggar was his guest
whose beard , descending , swept his aged breast
AABB
the ruined spendthrift , now no longer proud
claimed kindred there , and had his claims allowed
the broken soldier , kindly bade to stay
sat by his fire and talked the night away
AABB
wept o'er his wounds , or , tales of sorrow done
shouldered his crutch , and showed how fields were won
pleased with his guests , the good man learned to glow
and quite forgot their vices in their woe
AABB
i served my sentence — a bitter pill
some fellows should take who never will
and then i decided to go “ out west
concludin ’ ‘ twould suit my health the best
AABB
where , how i prospered , i never could tell
but fortune seemed to like we [ me ] well
an ’ somehow every vein i struck
was always bubblin ’ over with luck
AABB
an ’ , better than that , i was steady an ’ true
an ’ put my good resolutions through
but i wrote to a trusty old neighbor , an ’ said
“ you tell ‘ em , old fellow , that i am dead
AABB
he needs no praise of us , who wrought so well
who has the master 's praise ; who at his post
stood to the last . yet , now , from coast to coast
let memory of him peal like some great bell
ABBA
of him as woodsman , workman , let it tell
of him as lawyer , statesman , without boast
and for what qualities we love him most
and recollections that no time can quell
ABBA
he needs no praise of us , yet let us praise
albeit his simple soul we may offend
that liked not praise , being most diffident
still let us praise him , praise him in such ways
ABBA
there is no picturesqueness and no glory
no halo of romance , in war to day
it is a hideous thing ; time would turn grey
with horror , were he not already hoary
ABBA
at sight of this vile monster , foul and gory
yet while sweet women perish as they pray
and new born babes are slaughtered , who dare say
‘ halt ! ’ till right pens its ‘ finis ’ to the story
ABBA
there is no pathway , but the path through blood
out of the horrors of this holocaust
hell has let loose its scalding crimson flood
and he who stops to argue now is lost
ABAB
for thee old legends breathed historic breath
thou sawest poseidon in the purple sea
and in the sunset jason 's fleece of gold
o , what hadst thou to do with cruel death
ABBA
aloof within the day 's enormous dome
he holds unshared the silence of the sky
far down his bleak , relentless eyes descry
the eagle 's empire and the falcon 's home
ABBA
far down , the galleons of sunset roam
his hazards on the sea of morning lie
serene , he hears the broken tempest sigh
where cold sierras gleam like scattered foam
ABBA
and least of all he holds the human swarm
unwitting now that envious men prepare
to make their dream and its fulfillment one
when , poised above the caldrons of the storm
ABBA
to stab my youth with desperate knives , to wear
this paltry age 's gaudy livery
to let each base hand filch my treasury
to mesh my soul within a woman 's hair
ABBA
and be mere fortune 's lackeyed groom ,— i swear
i love it not ! these things are less to me
than the thin foam that frets upon the sea
less than the thistledown of summer air
ABBA
which hath no seed : better to stand aloof
far from these slanderous fools who mock my life
knowing me not , better the lowliest roof
fit for the meanest hind to sojourn in
ABAB
thus mortal war was wag 'd on either side
meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide
for , anxious , from evander when he went
he sought the tyrrhene camp , and tarchon 's tent
AABB
expos 'd the cause of coming to the chief
his name and country told , and ask 'd relief
propos 'd the terms ; his own small strength declar 'd
what vengeance proud mezentius had prepar 'd
AABB
“ too late , o friend ! my rashness i deplore
these shafts , once fatal , carry death no more
tydeus ’ and atreus ’ sons their points have found
and undissembled gore pursued the wound
AABB
in vain they bleed : this unavailing bow
serves , not to slaughter , but provoke the foe
in evil hour these bended horns i strung
and seized the quiver where it idly hung
AABB
cursed be the fate that sent me to the field
without a warrior ’ s arms , the spear and shield
if e ’ er with life i quit the trojan plain
if e ’ er i see my spouse and sire again
AABB
fraught with this cargo , and her fairest freight
delightful waltz , on tiptoe for a mate
the welcome vessel reach 'd the genial strand
and round her flock 'd the daughters of the land
AABB
not decent david , when , before the ark
his grand pas seul excited some remark
not love lorn quixote , when his sancho thought
the knight 's fandango friskier than it ought
AABB
not soft herodias , when , with winning tread
her nimble feet danced off another 's head
not cleopatra on her galley 's deck
display 'd so much of leg , or more of neck
AABB
if truth there be in old cratinus ’ song
no verse , you know , maecenas , can live long
writ by a water drinker . since the day
when bacchus took us poets into pay
AABB
with fauns and satyrs , the celestial nine
have smelt each morning of last evening 's wine
the praises heaped by homer on the bowl
at once convict him as a thirsty soul
AABB
and father ennius ne'er could be provoked
to sing of battles till his lips were soaked
“ let temperate folk write verses in the hall
where bonds change hands , abstainers not at all
AABB
i dare not move my dim eyes any way
despair behind , and death before doth cast
such terror ; and my feeble flesh doth waste
by sin in it , which it towards hell doth weigh
ABBA
only them art above , and when towards thee
by thy leave i can look , i rise again
but our old subtle foe so tempteth me
that not one hour myself i can sustain
ABAB
achilles speeds from tent to tent , and warms
his hardy myrmidons to blood and arms
all breathing death , around the chief they stand
a grim , terrific , formidable band
AABB
to the black fount they rush , a hideous throng
with paunch distended , and with lolling tongue
fire fills their eye , their black jaws belch the gore
and gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more
AABB
as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i , made lame by fortune 's dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
ABAB
for whether beauty , birth , or wealth , or wit
or any of these all , or all , or more
entitled in thy parts , do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
ABAB
who list the romane greatnes forth to figure
him needeth not to seeke for usage right
of line , or lead , or rule , or squaire , to measure
her length , her breadth , her deepnes , or her hight
ABAB
but him behooves to vew in compasse round
all that the ocean graspes in his long armes
be it where the yerely starre doth scortch the ground
or where colde boreas blowes his bitter stormes
ABAB
ay ! it was so ; and julio had fain
have been a warrior ; but his very brain
grew fever 'd at the sickly thought of death
and to be stricken with a want of breath
AABB
to be the food of worms — inanimate
and cold as winter ,— and as desolate
and then to waste away , and be no more
than the dark dust !— the thought was like a sore
AABB
that gather 'd in his heart ; and he would say
“ a curse be on their laurels ! ” and decay
came over them ; the deeds that they had done
had fallen with their fortunes ; and anon
AABB
the frightened herds of clouds across the sky
trample the sunshine down , and chase the day
into the dusky forest lands of gray
and sombre twilight . far and faint , and high
ABBA
the wild goose trails his harrow , with a cry
sad as the wail of some poor castaway
who sees a vessel drifting far astray
of his last hope , and lays him down to die
ABBA
the children , riotous from school , grow bold
and quarrel with the wind whose angry gust
plucks off the summer hat , and flaps the fold
of many a crimson cloak , and twirls the dust
ABAB
there shone a comet , and it was full west
my thoughts presag è d what it did portend
i found it threatened to my heart unrest
and might in time my joys and comfort end
ABAB
i further sought and found it was a sun
which day nor night did never use to set
it constant stood when heavens did restless run
and did their virtues and their forces let
ABAB
the world did muse and wonder what it meant
a sun to shine and in the west to rise
to search the truth , i strength and spirits spent
at length i found it was my licia 's eyes
ABAB
happy the maimed , the halt , the mad , the blind
all who , stamped separate by curtailing birth
owe no duty ’ s allegiance to mankind
nor stand a valuing in their scheme of worth
ABAB
but i , whom fate , not nature , did curtail
by no exterior voidness being exempt
must bear accusing glances where i fail
fixed in the general orbit of contempt
ABAB
fate , less than nature in being kind to lacking
giving the ill , shows not as outer cause
making our mock free will the mirror ’ s backing
which fate ’ s own acts as if in itself shows
ABAB
if in the summer of thy bright regard
for one brief season these poor rhymes shall live
i ask no more , nor think my fate too hard
if other eyes but wintry looks should give
ABAB
nor will i grieve though what i here have writ
o'erburdened time should drop among the ways
and to the unremembering dust commit
beyond the praise and blame of other days
ABAB
the song doth pass , but i who sing , remain
i pluck from death 's own heart a life more deep
and as the spring , that dies not , in her train
doth scatter blossoms for the winds to reap
ABAB
thenceforth i gan in my engrieved brest
to scorne all difference of great and small
sith that the greatest often are opprest
and unawares doe into daunger fall
ABAB
and ye , that read these ruines tragicall
learne , by their losse , to love the low degree
and if that fortune chaunce you up to call
to honours seat , forget not what you be
ABAB
honora , shou 'd that cruel time arrive
when ‘ gainst my truth thou should'st my errors poize
scorning remembrance of our vanish 'd joys
when for the love warm looks , in which i live
ABBA
but cold respect must greet me , that shall give
no tender glance , no kind regretful sighs
when thou shalt pass me with averted eyes
feigning thou see'st me not , to sting , and grieve
ABBA
and sicken my sad heart , i cou 'd not bear
such dire eclipse of thy soul cheering rays
i cou 'd not learn my struggling heart to tear
from thy lov 'd form , that thro ’ my memory strays
ABAB
light of our fathers ’ eyes , and in our own
star of the unsetting sunset ! for thy name
that on the front of noon was as a flame
in the great year nigh thirty years agone
ABBA
when all the heavens of europe shook and shone
with stormy wind and lightning , keeps its fame
and bears its witness all day through the same
not for past days and great deeds past alone
ABBA
scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn
and scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade
when cytherea , all in love forlorn
a longing tarriance for adonis made
ABAB
under an osier growing by a brook
a brook where adon used to cool his spleen
hot was the day ; she hotter that did look
for his approach , that often there had been
ABAB
anon he comes , and throws his mantle by
and stood stark naked on the brook 's green brim
the sun look 'd on the world with glorious eye
yet not so wistly as this queen on him
ABAB
at last with ling'ring steps she takes her way
to where great massive rocks like near the bay
upon a rock which seems a resting place
just formed by nature for some tired queen
AABB
“ as ever on this side the boiling wave
thou seest diminishing , ” the centaur said
“ so on the other , be thou well assur 'd
it lower still and lower sinks its bed
ABAB
unready to forego what i forsook
this say i , having counted up the cost
this , though i be the feeblest of god 's host
the sorriest sheep christ shepherds with his crook
ABBA
so spoke the blest immortal ; when more near
his northern wilds in all their breadth appear
lands yet unknown , and streams without a name
rise into vision and demand their fame
AABB
as when some saint first gains his bright abode
vaults o'er the spheres and views the works of god
sees earth , his kindred orb , beneath him roll
here glow the centre , and there point the pole
AABB
o'er land and sea his eyes delighted rove
and human thoughts his heavenly joys improve
with equal scope the raptured hero 's sight
ranged the low vale , or climb 'd the cloudy height
AABB
were't not for you , here should my pen have rest
and take a long leave of sweet poesy
britannia 's swains , and rivers far by west
should hear no more mine oaten melody
ABAB
yet shall the song i sung of them awhile
unperfect lie , and make no further known
the happy loves of this our pleasant isle
till i have left some record of mine own
ABAB
you are the subject now , and , writing you
i well may versify , not poetize
here needs no fiction : for the graces true
and virtues clip not with base flatteries
ABAB
could i outwear my present state of woe
with one brief winter , and indue i ’ the spring
hues of fresh youth , and mightily outgrow
the wan dark coil of faded suffering
ABAB
forth in the pride of beauty issuing
a sheeny snake , the light of vernal bowers
moving his crest to all sweet plots of flowers
and watered vallies where the young birds sing
ABBA
could i thus hope my lost delights renewing
i straightly would commend the tears to creep
from my charged lids ; but inwardly i weep
some vital heat as yet my heart is wooing
ABBA
there were no heaven but for lovers ’ eyes
save in their depths do all elysiums fade
and gods were dead but for the life that lies
in kisses sweet on sweeter altars laid
ABAB
there were no heroes did not lovers ride
and pyramid high deeds upon new time
nor tale for feast , or field , or chimney side
and harps were dumb and song had ne'er a rhyme
ABAB
in summers day , when phoebus fairly shone
i saw a bull as white as driven snowe
with gilden homes embowed like the moone
in a fresh flowring meadow lying lowe
ABAB
up to his eares the verdant grasse did growe
and the gay floures did offer to be eaten
but he with fatnes so did overflows
that he all wallowed in the weedes downe beaten
ABAB
ne car 'd with them his daintie lips to sweeten
till that a brize *, a scorned little creature
through his faire hide his angrie sting did threaten
and vext so sore , that all his goodly feature
ABAB
what seekest thou far in the unknown land
in hope i follow joy gone on before
in hope and fear persistent more and more
as the dry desert lengthens out its sand
ABBA
whilst day and night i carry in my hand
the golden key to ope the golden door
of golden home ; yet mine eye weepeth sore
for the long journey that must make no stand
ABBA
and who is this that veiled doth walk with thee
lo , this is love that walketh at my right
one exile holds us both , and we are bound
to selfsame home joys in the land of light
ABAB
you say that love then led us — you and me
i say ‘ twas hate , that wore love 's wanting eyes
hate that i could not tear away the lies
that wrapped you with their silken sorcery
ABBA
aye , hate that i could love you not tho love
pent in me ached with passion born distress
while thro unfathomable dark the prize
seemed sinking , as my soul , from heaven above
ABBA
mysterious night ! when our first parent knew
thee from report divine , and heard thy name
did he not tremble for this lovely frame
this glorious canopy of light and blue
ABBA
yet ‘ neath a curtain of translucent dew
bathed in the rays of the great setting flame
hesperus with the host of heaven came
and lo ! creation widened in man 's view
ABBA
who could have thought such darkness lay concealed
within thy beams , o sun ! or who could find
whilst flow'r and leaf and insect stood revealed
that to such countless orbs thou mad'st us blind
ABAB
and therefore if to love can be desert
i am not all unworthy . cheeks as pale
as these you see , and trembling knees that fail
to bear the burden of a heavy heart
ABBA
to these things ? o beloved , it is plain
i am not of thy worth nor for thy place
and yet , because i love thee , i obtain
from that same love this vindicating grace
ABAB
when i do think my meanest line shall be
more in time ’ s use than my creating whole
that future eyes more clearly shall feel me
in this inked page than in my direct soul
ABAB
when i conjecture put to make me seeing
good readers of me in some aftertime
thankful to some idea of my being
that doth not even my with gone true soul rime
ABAB
an anger at the essence of the world
that makes this thus , or thinkable this wise
takes my soul by the throat and makes it hurled
in nightly horrors of despaired surmise
ABAB
or like the echo of a passing bell
which sounding on the water seems to howl
so rings my heart a fearful heavy knell
and keeps all night in consort with the owl
ABAB
my cheeks with a thin ice of tears are clad
mine eyes like morning stars are bleared and red
what resteth then but i be raging mad
to see that she , my cares ’ chief conduit head
ABAB
beauty and love let no one separate
whom exact nature did to each other fit
giving to beauty love as finishing fate
and to love beauty as true colour of it
ABAB
let he but friend be who the soul finds fair
but let none love outside the body ’ s thought
so the seen couple ’ s togetherness shall bear
truth to the beauty each in the other sought
ABAB
the beach was crowded . pausing now and then
he groped and fiddled doggedly along
his worn face glaring on the thoughtless throng
the stony peevishness of sightless men
ABBA
he seemed scarce older than his clothes . again
grotesquing thinly many an old sweet song
so cracked his fiddle , his hand so frail and wrong
you hardly could distinguish one in ten
ABBA
he stopped at last , and sat him on the sand
and , grasping wearily his bread winner
stared dim towards the blue immensity
then leaned his head upon his poor old hand
ABBA
i know myself . not servile for applause
my muse permits no deprecating clause
modest or vain , she will not be denied
one bold confession due to honest pride
AABB
and well she knows the drooping veil of song
shall save her boldness from the caviller 's wrong
her sweeter voice the heavenly maid imparts
to tell the secrets of our aching hearts
AABB
for this , a suppliant , captive , prostrate , bound
she kneels imploring at the feet of sound
for this , convulsed in thought 's maternal pains
she loads her arms with rhyme 's resounding chains
AABB
the king of ocean to the fight descends
through all the whistling darts his course he bends
swift interposed between the warrior flies
and casts thick darkness o ’ er achilles ’ eyes
AABB
from great æ neas ’ shield the spear he drew
and at his master ’ s feet the weapon threw
that done , with force divine he snatch ’ d on high
the dardan prince , and bore him through the sky
AABB
smooth gliding without step , above the heads
of warring heroes , and of bounding steeds
till at the battle ’ s utmost verge they light
where the slow caucans close the rear of fight
AABB
the next , though distant , menelaus succeeds
while thus young nestor animates his steeds
“ now , now , my generous pair , exert your force
not that we hope to match tydides ’ horse
AABB
since great minerva wings their rapid way
and gives their lord the honours of the day
but reach atrides ! shall his mare outgo
your swiftness ? vanquish ’ d by a female foe
AABB
through your neglect , if lagging on the plain
the last ignoble gift be all we gain
no more shall nestor ’ s hand your food supply
the old man ’ s fury rises , and ye die
AABB
if laura — lady of the flower soft face
should light upon these verses , she may take
the tenderest line , and through its pulses trace
what man can suffer for a woman 's sake
ABAB
for in the nights that burn , the days that break
a thin pale figure stands in passion 's place
and peace comes not , nor yet the perished grace
of youth , to keep old faiths and fires awake
ABBA
ah ! marvellous maid . life sobs , and sighing saith
“ she left me , fleeting like a fluttered dove
but i would have a moment of her breath
so i might taste the sweetest sense thereof
ABAB
if e'er again return those awful days
whose clouds were crimsoned with the beacon 's blaze
whose grass was trampled by the soldier 's heel
whose tides were reddened round the rushing keel
AABB
god grant some lyre may wake a nobler strain
to rend the silence of our tented plain
when gallia 's flag its triple fold displays
her marshalled legions peal the marseillaise
AABB
when round the german close the war clouds dim
far through their shadows floats his battle hymn
when , crowned with joy , the camps ’ of england ring
a thousand voices shout , “ god save the king
AABB
one sun unto my life 's day gives true light
one moon dissolves my stormy night of woes
one star my fate and happy fortune shows
one saint i serve , one shrine with vows i dight
ABBA
one sun transfix 'd hath burnt my heart outright
one moon opposed my love in darkness throws
one star hath bid my thoughts my wrongs disclose
saints scorn poor swains , shrines do my vows no right
ABBA
yet if my love be found a holy fire
pure , unstained , without idolatry
and she nathless in hate of my desire
lives to repose her in my misery
ABAB
yet more , when fair lavinia fed the fire
before the gods , and stood beside her sire
( strange to relate !) the flames , involv 'd in smoke
of incense , from the sacred altar broke
AABB
caught her dishevel 'd hair and rich attire
her crown and jewels crackled in the fire
from thence the fuming trail began to spread
and lambent glories danc 'd about her head
AABB
this new portent the seer with wonder views
then pausing , thus his prophecy renews
“ the nymph , who scatters flaming fires around
shall shine with honor , shall herself be crown 'd
AABB
this band dismiss 'd , behold , another crowd
preferr 'd the same request , and lowly bow 'd
the constant tenor of whose well spent days
no less deserved a just return of praise
AABB
but straight the direful trump of slander sounds
through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds
loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies
the dire report through every region flies
AABB
in every ear incessant rumours rung
and gathering scandals grew on every tongue
from the black trumpet 's rusty concave broke
sulphureous flames , and clouds of rolling smoke
AABB
“ teacups , arouse ! ” ‘ t was thus the spell i broke
the drowsy started and the slumberers woke
“ the sleep i promised you have now enjoyed
due to your hour of labor well employed
AABB
swiftly the busy moments have been passed
this , our first ‘ teacups , ’ must not be our last
here , on this spot , now consecrated ground
the order of ‘ the teacups ’ let us found
AABB
by winter 's fireside and in summer 's bower
still shall it claim its ever welcome hour
in distant regions where our feet may roam
the magic teapot find or make a home
AABB
then swift as wind , o ’ er lemnos ’ smoky isle
they wing their way , and imbrus ’ sea beat soil
through air , unseen , involved in darkness glide
and light on lectos , on the point of ide
AABB
( mother of savages , whose echoing hills
are heard resounding with a hundred rills
fair ida trembles underneath the god
hush ’ d are her mountains , and her forests nod
AABB
there on a fir , whose spiry branches rise
to join its summit to the neighbouring skies
dark in embowering shade , conceal ’ d from sight
sat sleep , in likeness of the bird of night
AABB
my own beloved , who hast lifted me
from this drear flat of earth where i was thrown
and , in betwixt the languid ringlets , blown
a life breath , till the forehead hopefully
ABBA
shines out again , as all the angels see
before thy saving kiss ! my own , my own
who camest to me when the world was gone
and i who looked for only god , found thee
ABBA
i find thee ; i am safe , and strong , and glad
as one who stands in dewless asphodel
looks backward on the tedious time he had
in the upper life ,— so i , with bosom swell
ABAB
wherefore should i mine own heart not unfold
and his true workings to the world disclose
why self unlocking for unseemly hold
which me , as i show 'd others , human shows
ABAB
if i to nature held her truthful glass
and on the stage life 's self did strive to set
creating thousand shadows that should pass
for very substance when men 's eyes they met
ABAB
if there i imag 'd love , hate , doubt , and trust
if all the pageant of the mortal heart
might not one say : ‘ this man within him must
have learn 'd from nature what he shap 'd in art
ABAB
river , that stealest with such silent pace
around the city of the dead , where lies
a friend who bore thy name , and whom these eyes
shall see no more in his accustomed place
ABBA
linger and fold him in thy soft embrace
and say good night , for now the western skies
are red with sunset , and gray mists arise
like damps that gather on a dead man 's face
ABBA
good night ! good night ! as we so oft have said
beneath this roof at midnight in the days
that are no more , and shall no more return
thou hast but taken thy lamp and gone to bed
ABBA
thus live undying through the lapse of time
the solemn legends of the warrior 's clime
like egypt 's pyramid or paestum 's fane
they stand the heralds of the voiceless plain
AABB
yet not like them , for time , by slow degrees
saps the gray stone and wears the embroidered frieze
and isis sleeps beneath her subject nile
and crumbled neptune strews his dorian pile
AABB
but art 's fair fabric , strengthening as it rears
its laurelled columns through the mist of years
as the blue arches of the bending skies
still gird the torrent , following as it flies
AABB
with re united europe , grateful raise
to heaven glad paeans of exultant praise
for see , crest fallen strife , abashed , retreats
as berlin 's congress her design defeats
AABB
while justice , peace and hope effulgent stand
aiding the council of the patriot band
grand conclave of the wise , ‘ twas well ye bade
such heaven born guests lend to your council aid
AABB
our love was new , and then but in the spring
when i was wont to greet it with my lays
as philomel in summer 's front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days
ABAB
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
ABAB
how sweet the tuneful bells ’ responsive peal
as when , at opening morn , the fragrant breeze
breathes on the trembling sense of pale disease
so piercing to my heart their force i feel
ABBA
and hark ! with lessening cadence now they fall
and now , along the white and level tide
they fling their melancholy music wide
bidding me many a tender thought recall
ABBA
of summer days , and those delightful years
when from an ancient tower , in life 's fair prime
the mournful magic of their mingling chime
first waked my wondering childhood into tears
ABBA
to whom the swain : “ i hear and i obey
but old laertes weeps his life away
and deems thee lost : shall i speed employ
to bless his age : a messenger of joy
AABB
the mournful hour that tore his son away
sent the sad sire in solitude to stray
yet busied with his slaves , to ease his woe
he dress 'd the vine , and bade the garden blow
AABB
nor food nor wine refused ; but since the day
that you to pylos plough 'd the watery way
nor wine nor food he tastes ; but , sunk in woes
wild springs the vine , no more the garden blows
AABB
and yet , because thou overcomest so
because thou art more noble and like a king
thou canst prevail against my fears and fling
thy purple round me , till my heart shall grow
ABBA
too close against thine heart henceforth to know
how it shook when alone . why , conquering
may prove as lordly and complete a thing
in lifting upward , as in crushing low
ABBA
and as a vanquished soldier yields his sword
to one who lifts him from the bloody earth
even so , beloved , i at last record
here ends my strife . if thou invite me forth
ABAB
let not the scornful ask me what avails
so small a pack to follow mighty trails
long since i saw what difference must be
between a stream like you , a ditch like me
AABB
this drains a garden and a homely field
which scarce at times a living current yield
the other from the high lands of his birth
plunges through rocks and spurns the pastoral earth
AABB
then settling silent to his deeper course
draws in his fellows to augment his force
becomes a name , and broadening as he goes
gives power and purity where'er he flows
AABB
muse of the many twinkling feet ! whose charms
are now extended up from legs to arms
terpsichore !— too long misdeem 'd a maid
reproachful term — bestow 'd but to upbraid
AABB
henceforth in all the bronze of brightness shine
the least a vestal of the virgin nine
far be from thee and thine the name of prude
mock 'd , yet triumphant ; sneer 'd at , unsubdued
AABB
thy legs must move to conquer as they fly
if but thy coats are reasonably high
thy breast , if bare enough , requires no shield
dance forth — sans armour thou shalt take the field
AABB
when winter snows upon thy sable hairs
and frost of age hath nipped thy beauties near
when dark shall seem thy day that never clears
and all lies withered that was held so dear
ABAB
this may remain thy lasting monument
which happily posterity may cherish
these colours with thy fading are not spent
these may remain when thou and i shall perish
ABAB
sweet bird , that sing'st away the early hours
of winters past or coming , void of care
well pleased with delights which present are
fair seasons , budding sprays , sweet smelling flowers
ABBA
to rocks , to springs , to rills , from leafy bowers
thou thy creator 's goodness dost declare
and what dear gifts on thee he did not spare
a stain to human sense in sin that lowers
ABBA
what soul can be so sick , which by thy songs
attired in sweetness , sweetly is not driven
quite to forget earth 's turmoils , spites , and wrongs
and lift a reverend eye and thought to heaven
ABAB
“ the barley harvest was nodding white
when my children died on the rocky height
and the reapers were singing on hill and plain
when i came to my task of sorrow and pain
AABB
but now the season of rain is nigh
the sun is dim in the thickening sky
and the clouds in sullen darkness rest
where he hides his light at the doors of the west
AABB
i hear the howl of the wind that brings
the long drear storm on its heavy wings
but the howling wind and the driving rain
will beat on my houseless head in vain
AABB
when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days , in this dark world and wide
and that one talent , which is death to hide
lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent
ABBA
to serve therewith my maker , and present
my true account , lest he , returning , chide
‘ doth god exact day labour , light denied
i fondly ask . but patience , to prevent
ABBA
that murmur , soon replies : ‘ god doth not need
either man 's work or his own gifts . who best
bear his mild yoke , they serve him best . his state
is kingly . thousands , at his bidding , speed
ABBA
that emperour , who left us franks on guard
a thousand score stout men he set apart
and well he knows , not one will prove coward
man for his lord should suffer with good heart
ABAB
o goodness in horror ! o ill not all ill
in the worst of the worst may be fierce hope still
to morrow with dawn will come many a wain
and bear away loads of human pain
AABB
piles of pale beds for the ‘ spitals ; but some
again will awake in home mornings , and some
dull herds of the war , again follow the drum
from others , faint blood shall in families flow
ABAB
with wonder at life , and young oldness in woe
yet hence may the movers of great earth grow
now , even now , i hear them at hand
though again captain sword is up in the land
AABB
and how fare you ? if you deserve in truth
the name men give you , you 're a happy youth
rome 's thousand tongues , agreed at least in this
ascribe to you a plenitude of bliss
AABB
yet , when you judge of self , i fear you 're prone
to take another 's word before your own
to think of happiness as ‘ twere a prize
that men may win though neither good nor wise
AABB
just so the glutton whom the world thinks well
keeps dark his fever till the dinner bell
then , as he 's eating , with his hands well greased
shivering comes on , and proves the fool diseased
AABB
but first , by reason let me prove , i pray
that evil such as this , and which you say
oft weighs you down with soul corroding care
is only in the mind :— mere spright of air
AABB
your hat upon your head for instance place
less gently rather than 's your usual case
pray , do n't it presently at ease remain
and from it do you aught amiss retain
AABB
not e'en a spot ; there 's nothing half so clear
the features , too , they as before appear
no difference assuredly you see
then how can cuckoldom an evil be
AABB
i have dreamed of death :— what will it be to die
not in a dream , but in the literal truth
with all death 's adjuncts ghastly and uncouth
the pang that is the last and the last sigh
ABBA
too dulled , it may be , for a last good bye
too comfortless for any one to soothe
a helpless charmless spectacle of ruth
through long last hours , so long while yet they fly
ABBA
sweet song flower of the mayspring of our song
be welcome to us , with loving thanks and praise
to his good hand who travelling on strange ways
found thee forlorn and fragrant , lain along
ABBA
beneath dead leaves that many a winter 's wrong
had rained and heaped through nigh three centuries ’ maze
above thy maybloom , hiding from our gaze
the life that in thy leaves lay sweet and strong
ABBA
for thine have life , while many above thine head
piled by the wind lie blossomless and dead
so now disburdened of such load above
that lay as death 's own dust upon thee shed
AABB
since i have lackt the comfort of that light
the which was wont to lead my thoughts astray
i wander as in darknesse of the night
affrayd of every dangers least dismay
ABAB
ne ought i see , though in the clearest day
when others gaze upon theyr shadowes vayne
but th'only image of that heavenly ray
whereof some glance doth in mine eie remayne
ABAB
of which beholding the idaea playne
through contemplation of my purest part
with light thereof i doe my self sustayne
and thereon feed my love affamisht hart
ABAB
but you who take the city for your own
come with me when the night flows deep and kind
along these narrow ways of troubled stone
and floods the wide savannas of the mind
ABAB
with tides that cool the fever of the day
one with the dark , companioned by the stars
we 'll seek st. philip 's , nebulous and gray
holding its throbbing beacon to the bars
ABAB
a prisoned spirit vibrant in the stone
that knew its empire of forgotten things
then will the city know you for her own
and feel you meet to share her sufferings
ABAB
if music and sweet poetry agree
as they must needs , the sister and the brother
then must the love be great ‘ twixt thee and me
because thou lovest the one , and i the other
ABAB
dowland to thee is dear , whose heavenly touch
upon the lute doth ravish human sense
spenser to me , whose deep conceit is such
as , passing all conceit , needs no defence
ABAB
beneath his feet fell haughty hebrus dead
then latagus , and palmus as he fled
at latagus a weighty stone he flung
his face was flatted , and his helmet rung
AABB
but palmus from behind receives his wound
hamstring 'd he falls , and grovels on the ground
his crest and armor , from his body torn
thy shoulders , lausus , and thy head adorn
AABB
evas and mimas , both of troy , he slew
mimas his birth from fair theano drew
born on that fatal night , when , big with fire
the queen produc 'd young paris to his sire
AABB
his lance bold thoas at the conqueror sent
deep in his breast above the pap it went
amid the lungs was fix ’ d the winged wood
and quivering in his heaving bosom stood
AABB
till from the dying chief , approaching near
the æ tolian warrior tugg ’ d his weighty spear
then sudden waved his flaming falchion round
and gash ’ d his belly with a ghastly wound
AABB
the corpse now breathless on the bloody plain
to spoil his arms the victor strove in vain
the thracian bands against the victor press ’ d
a grove of lances glitter ’ d at his breast
AABB
how should i sing when buffeting salt waves
and stung with bitter surges , in whose might
i toss , a cockleshell ? the dreadful night
marshals its undefeated dark and raves
ABBA
in brutal madness , reeling over graves
of vanquished men , long sunken out of sight
sent wailing down to glut the ghoulish sprite
who haunts foul seaweed forests and their caves
ABBA
no parting cloud reveals a watery star
my cries are washed away upon the wind
my cramped and blistering hands can find no spar
my eyes with hope o'erstrained , are growing blind
ABAB
ah ! why hath nature to so hard a hart
given so goodly giftes of beauties grace
whose pryde depraves each other better part
and all those pretious ornaments deface
ABAB
sith to all other beastes of bloody race
a dreadfull countenance she given hath
that with theyr terrour all the rest may chace
and warne to shun the daunger of theyr wrath
ABAB
my hope and heart is with thee — thou wilt be
a latter luther , and a soldier priest
to scare church harpies from the master 's feast
our dusted velvets have much need of thee
ABBA
with iron worded proof , hating to hark
the humming of the drowsy pulpit drone
half god 's good sabbath , while the worn out clerk
brow beats his desk below . thou from a throne
ABAB
so spoke the god who darts celestial fires
he dreads his fury , and some steps retires
then phoebus bore the chief of venus ’ race
to troy ’ s high fane , and to his holy place
AABB
latona there and phoebe heal ’ d the wound
with vigour arm ’ d him , and with glory crown ’ d
this done , the patron of the silver bow
a phantom raised , the same in shape and show
AABB
with great æ neas ; such the form he bore
and such in fight the radiant arms he wore
around the spectre bloody wars are waged
and greece and troy with clashing shields engaged
AABB
oft let me range the gloomy aisles alone
sad luxury ! to vulgar minds unknown
along the walls where speaking marbles show
what worthies form the hallowed mould belew
AABB
proud names , who once the reins of empire held
in arms who triumphed , or in arts excelled
chiefs , graced with scars , and prodigal of blood
stern patriots , who for sacred freedom stood
AABB
just men , by whom impartial laws were given
and saints , who taught and led the way to heaven
ne'er to these chambers , where the mighty rest
since their foundation came a nobler guest
AABB
into a stately dwelling dark and old
a woman glides with troubled , weary air
her face is pale , her hands are white and cold
the silken hood falls from her loosened hair
ABAB
she heeds it not , but listlessly stands
with thoughtful eyes and tightly folded hands
at last the maid with noiseless step draws near
removes her wraps and in her listening ear
AABB
speaks these few words : “ in passing through the crowd
to night , a man of face and manner proud
this missive gave to me . i looked around
for one brief moment his face upon me frowned
AABB
sleep sent his angels forth ; with silent tread
from house to house , they on their mission sped
watched by the couch of suffering and pain
soothed the pale brow and calmed the throbbing brain
AABB
eased the sad heart and closed the weeping eye
bade care and grief with their attendants fly
entered the chamber of the rich and great
nor scorned to visit those of mean estate
AABB
but blessed alike the lofty and the low
alike bade each forget their weight of woe
the proud and wealthy drew around their breast
“ the curtains of repose , ” and sank to rest
AABB
carved from the block or cast in clinging mould
will grateful memory fondly try her best
the mortal vesture from decay to wrest
his look shall greet us , calm , but ah , how cold
ABBA
no breath can stir the brazen drapery 's fold
no throb can heave the statue 's stony breast
“ he is not here , but risen , ” will stand confest
in all we miss , in all our eyes behold
ABBA
how nature loved him ! on his placid brow
thought 's ample dome , she set the sacred sign
that marks the priesthood of her holiest shrine
nor asked a leaflet from the laurel 's bough
ABBA
arab , egyptian , english — by the sword
cloven , or pierced with spears , or bullet mown
in equal fate they sleep : their dust is grown
a portion of the fiery sands abhorred
ABBA
and thou , what hast thou , hero , for reward
thou , england 's glory and her shame ? o'erthrown
thou liest , unburied , or with grave unknown
as his to whom on nebo 's height the lord
ABBA
to garryowen upon an organ ground
two girls are jigging . riotously they trip
with eyes aflame , quick bosoms , hand on hip
as in the tumult of a witches ’ round
ABBA
youngsters and youngsters round them prance and bound
two solemn babes twirl ponderously , and skip
the artist 's teeth gleam from his bearded lip
high from the kennel howls a tortured hound
ABBA
the music reels and hurtles , and the night
is full of stinks and cries ; a naphtha light
flares from a barrow ; battered and obtused
with vices , wrinkles , life and work and rags
AABB
behold him trav'lling o'er th ’ extensive space
between the realms of darkness and our race
to pass it , scarcely he a moment took
on florence instantly he cast a look
AABB
delighted with the beauty of the spot
he there resolved to fix his earthly lot
regarding it as proper for his wiles
a city famed for wanton freaks and guiles
AABB
belphegor soon a noble mansion hired
and furnished it with ev'ry thing desired
as signor roderick he designed to pass
his equipage was large of ev'ry class
AABB
strained through the lattice , where the roses cling
and , with their fragrance , waft the notes around
her haunted senses . thirsting beyond bound
of her slow yielding dreams , the lilt and swing
ABBA
of the mysterious delirious tune
she drains like some strange opiate , with awed eyes
upraised against her casement , where aswoon
the stars fail from her sight , and up the skies
ABAB
no more the substance of the man remains
nor bounds the blood along the purple veins
these the funereal flames in atoms bear
to wander with the wind in empty air
AABB
while the impassive soul reluctant flies
like a vain dream , to these infernal skies
but from the dark dominions speed the way
and climb the steep ascent to upper day
AABB
of all the causes which conspire to blind
man 's erring judgment and misguide the mind
what the weak head with strongest bias rules
is pride , the never failing vice of fools
AABB
whatever nature has in worth denied
she gives in large recruits of needful pride
for as in bodies , thus in souls , we find
what wants in blood and spirits , swelled with wind
AABB
pride where wit fails steps in to our defense
and fills up all the mighty void of sense
if once right reason drives that cloud away
truth breaks upon us with resistless day
AABB
joy of the milliner , envy of the line
star of the parks , jack booted , sworded , helmed
he sits between his holsters , solid of spine
nor , as it seems , though westminster were whelmed
ABAB
with the great globe , in earthquake and eclipse
would he and his charger cease from mounting guard
this private in the blues , nor would his lips
move , though his gorge with throttled oaths were charred
ABAB
he wears his inches weightily , as he wears
his old world armours ; and with his port and pride
his sturdy graces and enormous airs
he towers , in speech his colonel countrified
ABAB
nay , lord , not thus ! white lilies in the spring
sad olive groves , or silver breasted dove
teach me more clearly of thy life and love
than terrors of red flame and thundering
ABBA
the hillside vines dear memories of thee bring
a bird at evening flying to its nest
tells me of one who had no place of rest
i think it is of thee the sparrows sing
ABBA
come rather on some autumn afternoon
when red and brown are burnished on the leaves
and the fields echo to the gleaner 's song
come when the splendid fulness of the moon
ABBA
were but my spirit loosed upon the air
by some high power who could life 's chains unbind
set free to seek what most it longs to find
to no proud court of kings would i repair
ABBA
i would but climb , once more , a narrow stair
when day was wearing late , and dusk was kind
and one should greet me to my failings blind
content so i but shared his twilight there
ABBA
nay ! well i know he waits not as of old
i could not find him in the old time place
i must pursue him , made by sorrow bold
through worlds unknown , in strange celestial race
ABAB
could'st thou resign the park and play , content
for the fair banks of severn or of trent
there might'st thou find some elegant retreat
some hireling senator 's deserted seat
AABB
and stretch thy prospects o'er the smiling land
for less than rent the dungeons of the strand
there prune thy walks , support thy drooping flowers
direct thy rivulets , and twine thy bowers
AABB
and , while thy grounds a cheap repast afford
despise the dainties of a venal lord
there every bush with nature 's music rings
there every breeze bears health upon its wings
AABB
though narrow be that old man 's cares , and near
the poor old man is greater than he seems
for he hath waking empire , wide as dreams
an ample sovereignty of eye and ear
ABBA
rich are his walks with supernatural chear
the region of his inner spirit teems
with vital sounds , and monitory gleams
of high astonishment and pleasing fear
ABBA
he the seven birds hath seen that never part
seen the seven whistlers in their nightly rounds
and counted them : and oftentimes will start
for overhead are sweeping gabriel 's hounds
ABAB
we never joy enjoy to that full point
regret doth wish joy had enjoy è d been
nor have the strength regret to disappoint
recalling not past joy ’ s thought , but its mien
ABAB
alas ! all this is useless , for joy ’ s in
enjoying , not in thinking of enjoying
its mere thought mirroring gainst itself doth sin
by mere reflecting solid life destroying
ABAB
and gawayne rubbed his arms , his chest he beat
then grasped the battle axe and braced his feet
and swung the ponderous weapon high in air
and brought it down like lightning , fair and square
AABB
upon the stranger 's neck . the axe flashed through
cutting the green knight cleanly right in two
and split the hard stone floor like kindling wood
the head dropped off ; out gushed the thick , hot blood
AABB
like — i can n't find the simile i want
but let us say a flood of cr ê me de menthe
and then the warriors standing round about
sent up from fifty throats a mighty shout
AABB
few words they said ; the balmy odorous wind
wandered about , some resting place to find
the young leaves rustled ‘ neath its gentle breath
and here and there some blossom burst his sheath
AABB
adding unnoticed fragrance to the night
but , as they pondered , a new golden light
streamed over the green garden , and they heard
sweet voices sing some ancient poet 's word
AABB
in praise of may , and then in sight there came
the minstrels ’ figures underneath the flame
of scented torches passing ‘ twixt the trees
and soon the dusky hall grew bright with these
AABB
what right to freedom when we are not free
when all the passions goad us into lust
when , for the worthless spoil we lick the dust
and while one half our people die , that we
ABBA
may sit with peace and freedom ‘ neath our tree
the other gloats for plunder and for spoil
bustles through daylight , vexes night with toil
cheats , swindles , lies and steals !— shall such things be
ABBA
endowed with such grand boons as liberty
brings in her train of blessings ? should we pray
that such as these should still maintain the sway
these soulless , senseless , heartless enemies
ABBA
how blest is he who knows no meaner strife
than art 's long battle with the foes of life
no doubt assails him , doing still his best
and trusting kindly nature for the rest
AABB
no mocking conscience tears the thin disguise
that wraps his breast , and tells him that he lies
he comes : the languid sufferer lifts his head
and smiles a welcome from his weary bed
AABB
he speaks : what music like the tones that tell
“ past is the hour of danger ,— all is well
how can he feel the petty stings of grief
whose cheering presence always brings relief
AABB
f. first a lucanian boar ; ‘ twas captured wild
( so the host told us ) when the wind was mild
around it , turnips , lettuce , radishes
by way of whet , with brine and coan lees
AABB
then , when the board , a maple one , was cleared
a high girt slave with purple cloth appeared
and rubbed and wiped it clean : another boy
removed the scraps , and all that might annoy
AABB
“ while dark hydaspes , like an attic maid
who carries ceres ’ basket , grave and staid
came in with caecuban , and , close behind
alcon with chian , which had ne'er been brined
AABB
and now with transport wild ernestus spies
dalarne 's continuous coast before him rise
ere yet he reach 'd the bank , the toiling oar
he dropp 'd , and sprung impatient to the shore
AABB
before him wide the dark brow 'd forests frown 'd
and morn 's still hour hush 'd all the space around
save where the whispers of the changeful breeze
half waved the summits of the towering trees
AABB
alone , and guided by a straggling beam
he hastened onward , where the murmuring stream
cut thro ’ the woods its liquid way , and laved
the grass , that round their trunks luxuriant waved
AABB
i have done i know not what ,— what have i done
my brother 's blood , my brother 's soul , doth cry
and i find no defence , find no reply
no courage more to run this race i run
ABBA
not knowing what i have done , have left undone
ah me , these awful unknown hours that fly
fruitless it may be , fleeting fruitless by
rank with death savor underneath the sun
ABBA
for what avails it that i did not know
the deed i did ? what profits me the plea
that had i known i had not wronged him so
lord jesus christ , my god , him pity thou
ABAB
o happy thames , that didst my stella bear
i saw thee with full many a smiling line
upon thy cheerful face joy 's livery wear
while those fair planets on thy streams did shine
ABAB
the boat for joy could not to dance forbear
while wanton winds , with beauties so divine
ravish 'd , stay 'd not , till in her golden hair
they did themselves ( o sweetest prison !) twine
ABAB
and fain those oeol 's youth there would their stay
have made ; but , forced by nature still to fly
first did with puffing kiss those locks display
she , so dishevell 'd , blush 'd . from window i
ABAB
in token of the love which thou hast shown
for this wide land of freedom , i have named
a province vast , and for its beauty famed
by thy dear name to be hereafter known
ABBA
alberta shall it be ! her fountains thrown
from alps unto three oceans , to all men
shall vaunt her loveliness e'en now ; and when
each little hamlet to a city grown
ABBA
and numberless as blades of prairie grass
or the thick leaves in distant forest bower
great peoples hear the giant currents pass
still shall the waters , bringing wealth and power
ABAB
as draws the golden meteor of the day
exhaled matter from the ground to heaven
and by his secret nature , there to stay
the thing fast held , and yet of hold bereaven
ABAB
so by th ’ attractive excellence and might
born to the power of thy transparent eyes
drawn from myself , ravished with thy delight
whose dumb conceits divinely sirenise
ABAB
this love even , all my worth , to the uttermost
i should not love withal , unless that thou
hadst set me an example , shown me how
when first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed
ABBA
and love called love . and thus , i cannot speak
of love even , as a good thing of my own
thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak
and placed it by thee on a golden throne
ABAB
you ask me for a sonnet . ah , my dear
can clocks tick back to yesterday at noon
can cracked and fallen leaves recall last june
and leap up on the boughs , now stiff and sere
ABBA
for your sake , i would go and seek the year
faded beyond the purple ranks of dune
blown sands of drifted hours , which the moon
streaks with a ghostly finger , and her sneer
ABBA
pulls at my lengthening shadow . yes , ‘ tis that
my shadow stretches forward , and the ground
is dark in front because the light 's behind
it is grotesque , with such a funny hat
ABBA
in secret they , the pleasing task pursue
but soon — ( what can escape a lovers view
soon dido saw the change , her boding mind
365 fancied , foresaw , or felt what they desgn 'd
AABB
379 till mad'ning flames within her bosom rise
distracted , furious , o'er the town she flies
wild as the woodnymph when the frantic rite
and bacchanalian shout , to rage excite
AABB
me , the poor motley , maim 'd by fortune 's spite
sear 'd and o'erworn with tyranny of time
whose wit was but the wit to learn to write
when thou , my muse , inspir'dst my pupil rhyme
ABAB
thou wert the wide world 's pride , but i his scorn
his pattern thou , i his poor toy and tool
whence therefore should that tender love be born
‘ twixt fortune 's minion thee , and me her fool
ABAB
o steep and rugged life , whose harsh ascent
slopes blindly upward through the bitter night
they say that on thy summit , high in light
sweet rest awaits the climber , travel spent
ABBA
but i , alas , with dusty garments rent
with fainting heart and failing limbs and sight
can see no glimmer of the shining height
and vainly list , with body forward bent
ABBA
to catch athwart the gloom one wandering note
of those glad anthems which ( they say ) are sung
when one emerges from the mists below
but though , o life , thy summit be remote
ABBA
he finish 'd ; and , one soul inspiring all
form 'd in a wedge , the foot approach the wall
without the town , an unprovided train
of gaping , gazing citizens are slain
AABB
some firebrands , others scaling ladders bear
and those they toss aloft , and these they rear
the flames now launch 'd , the feather 'd arrows fly
and clouds of missive arms obscure the sky
AABB
advancing to the front , the hero stands
and , stretching out to heav'n his pious hands
attests the gods , asserts his innocence
upbraids with breach of faith th ’ ausonian prince
AABB
her courts are by the flux of flaming ways
between the rivers and the illumined sky
whose fervid depths reverberate from on high
fierce lustres mingled in a fiery haze
ABBA
they mark it inland ; blithe and fair of face
her suitors follow , guessing by the glare
beyond the hilltops in the evening air
how bright the cressets at her portals blaze
ABBA
on the pure fronts defeat ere many a day
falls like the soot and dirt on city snow
there hopes deferred lie sunk in piteous seams
her paths are disillusion and decay
ABBA
i could not find the little maid content
so out i rushed , and sought her far and wide
but not where pleasure each new fancy tried
heading the maze of rioting merriment
ABBA
nor where , with restless eyes and bow half bent
love in the brake of sweetbriar smiled and sighed
nor yet where fame towered , crowned and glorified
found i her face , nor wheresoe'er i went
ABBA
so homeward back i crawled , like wounded bird
when lo ! content sate spinning at my door
and when i asked her where she was before
“ here all the time , ” she said ; “ i never stirred
ABBA
or whether in thy lovely mistresse praise
thou list to exercise thy learned quill
thy muse hath got such grace and power to please
with rare invention , beautified by skill
ABAB
as who therin can ever ioy their fill
o , therefore let that happy muse proceed
to clime the height of vertues sacred hill
where endlesse honour shal be made thy meed
ABAB
were i as base as is the lowly plain
and you , my love , as high as heaven above
yet should the thoughts of me , your humble swain
ascend to heaven in honor of my love
ABAB
were i as high as heaven above the plain
and you , my love , as humble and as low
as are the deepest bottoms of the main
wheresoe'er you were , with you my love should go
ABAB
were you the earth , dear love , and i the skies
my love should shine on you , like to the sun
and look upon you with ten thousand eyes
till heaven waxed blind and till the world were done
ABAB
whoever thinks a faultless piece to see
thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be
in every work regard the writer 's end
since none can compass more than they intend
AABB
and if the means be just , the conduct true
applause , in spite of trivial faults , is due
as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit
to avoid great errors , must the less commit
AABB
neglect the rules each verbal critic lays
for not to know some trifles is a praise
most critics , fond of some subservient art
still make the whole depend upon a part
AABB
the teian muse invites thee from above
to lay thy trumpet down , and sing of love
let montague describe boyn 's swelling flood
and purple streams fatned with hostile blood
AABB
o heavenly patron of the needy muse
whose powerful name can nobler heat infuse
when you nassau 's bright actions dar 'd to see
you was the eagle , and apollo he
AABB
but when he read you , and your value knew
he was the eagle , and apollo you
both spoke the bird in her æ thereal height
the majesty was his , and thine the flight
AABB
one that is ever kind said yesterday
“ your well beloved 's hair has threads of grey
and little shadows come about her eyes
time can but make it easier to be wise
AABB
though now it 's hard , till trouble is at an end
and so be patient , be wise and patient , friend
but , heart , there is no comfort , not a grain
time can but make her beauty over again
AABB
because of that great nobleness of hers
the fire that stirs about her , when she stirs
burns but more clearly . o she had not these ways
when all the wild summer was in her gaze
AABB
is it for fear to wet a widow 's eye
that thou consum'st thy self in single life
ah , if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
ABAB
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by children 's eyes , her husband 's shape in mind
ABAB
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place , for still the world enjoys it
but beauty 's waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
ABAB
“ forbear ( the progeny of jove replies
to calm thy fury i forsake the skies
let great achilles , to the gods resign ’ d
to reason yield the empire o ’ er his mind
AABB
by awful juno this command is given
the king and you are both the care of heaven
the force of keen reproaches let him feel
but sheathe , obedient , thy revenging steel
AABB
for i pronounce ( and trust a heavenly power
thy injured honour has its fated hour
when the proud monarch shall thy arms implores
and bribe thy friendship with a boundless store
AABB
round the rich throne , in various lustre dight
gems undistinguished cast a changing light
sapphire and emerald soften down the scene
cold azure mingling with the vernal green
AABB
pearl , amber , ruby warmer flames unfold
and diamonds brighten from the burning gold
thro all the dome the living blazes blend
and shoot their rainbows where the arches bend
AABB
on every ceiling , painted light and gay
symbolic forms their graphic art display
recording , confident of endless fame
each feat of arms , each patriarchal name
AABB
when we kept our watch in the cold and damp
if the cattle broke from the sleeping camp
over the flats and across the plain
with my head bent down on his waving mane
AABB
through the boughs above and the stumps below
on the darkest night i could let him go
at a racing speed ; he would choose his course
and my life was safe with the old grey horse
AABB
but man and horse had a favourite job
when an outlaw broke from a station mob
with a right good will was the stockwhip plied
as the old horse raced at the straggler 's side
AABB
in the lone tent , waiting for victory
she stands with eyes marred by the mists of pain
like some wan lily overdrenched with rain
the clamorous clang of arms , the ensanguined sky
ABBA
war 's ruin , and the wreck of chivalry
to her proud soul no common fear can bring
bravely she tarrieth for her lord the king
her soul a flame with passionate ecstasy
ABBA
o hair of gold ! o crimson lips ! o face
made for the luring and the love of man
with thee i do forget the toil and stress
the loveless road that knows no resting place
ABBA
long while i sought to what i might compare
those powrefull eies which lighten my dark spright
yet find i nought on earth , to which i dare
resemble th'ymage of their goodly light
ABAB
not to the sun , for they doo shine by night
nor to the moone , for they are changed never
nor to the starres , for they have purer sight
nor to the fire , for they consume not ever
ABAB
when we consider what this life we lead
is not , and is ; how full of toil and pain
how blank of rest and of substantial gain
beset by hunger earth can never feed
ABBA
and propping half our hearts upon a reed
we cease to mourn lost treasures mourned in vain
lost treasures we are fain and yet not fain
to fetch back for a solace of our need
ABBA
for who that feel this burden and this strain
this wide vacuity of hope and heart
would bring their cherished well beloved again
to bleed with them and wince beneath the smart
ABAB
when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days , in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodg 'd with me useless , though my soul more bent
ABBA
to serve therewith my maker , and present
my true account , lest he , returning , chide
doth god exact day labour , light denied
i fondly ask : but patience , to prevent
ABBA
that murmur , soon replies , god doth not need
either man 's work , or his own gifts ; who best
bear his mild yoke , they serve him best ; his state
is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed
ABBA
she leans , and there is laughter in the face
she turns towards him ; and it seems a door
suddenly opened on some desolate place
with a burst of light and music . what before
ABAB
was hidden shines in loveliness revealed
now first he sees her beautiful , and knows
that he must love her ; and the doom is sealed
of all his happiness and all the woes
ABAB
that shall be born of pregnant years hereafter
the swift poise of a head , a flutter of laughter
and love flows in on him , its vastness pent
within his narrow life : the pain it brings
AABB
not sweeter to the storm tossed mariner
is glimpse of home , where wife and children wait
to welcome him with kisses at the gate
than to the town worn man the breezy stir
ABBA
of mountain winds on rugged pathless heights
his long pent soul drinks in the deep delights
that nature hath in store . the sun kissed bay
gleams thro ’ the grand old gnarled gum tree boughs
AABB
like burnished brass ; the strong winged bird of prey
sweeps by , upon his lonely vengeful way
while over all , like breath of holy vows
the sweet airs blow , and the high vaulted sky
AABB
‘ twas but a moment , for that respect
which clothes all courage their voices checked
and something the wildest could understand
spake in the old man 's strong right hand
AABB
and his corded throat , and the lurking frown
of his eyebrows under his old bell crown
until , as they gazed , there crept an awe
through the ranks in whispers , and some men saw
AABB
in the antique vestments and long white hair
the past of the nation in battle there
and some of the soldiers since declare
that the gleam of his old white hat afar
AABB
meantime the trojan sends his troops ashore
some are by boats expos 'd , by bridges more
with lab'ring oars they bear along the strand
where the tide languishes , and leap aland
AABB
tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes
and , where no ford he finds , no water fries
nor billows with unequal murmurs roar
but smoothly slide along , and swell the shore
AABB
that course he steer 'd , and thus he gave command
“ here ply your oars , and at all hazard land
force on the vessel , that her keel may wound
this hated soil , and furrow hostile ground
AABB
oh , had we room to rip the mighty bags
that time , the harlequin , has stuffed with rags
grant us one moment to unloose the strings
while the old graybeard shuts his leather wings
AABB
but what a heap of motley trash appears
crammed in the bundles of successive years
as the lost rustic on some festal day
stares through the concourse in its vast array
AABB
where in one cake a throng of faces runs
all stuck together like a sheet of buns
and throws the bait of some unheeded name
or shoots a wink with most uncertain aim
AABB
o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
ABAB
the canker blooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly
when summer 's breath their masked buds discloses
ABAB
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwoo 'd and unrespected fade
die to themselves . sweet roses do not so
of then sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
ABAB
he said , and sorrow touch ’ d each argive breast
the soul of ajax burn ’ d above the rest
as by his side the groaning warrior fell
at the fierce foe he launch ’ d his piercing steel
AABB
the foe , reclining , shunn ’ d the flying death
but fate , archilochus , demands thy breath
thy lofty birth no succour could impart
the wings of death o ’ ertook thee on the dart
AABB
swift to perform heaven ’ s fatal will , it fled
full on the juncture of the neck and head
and took the joint , and cut the nerves in twain
the dropping head first tumbled on the plain
AABB
it may be , love my death doth not pretend
although he shoots at me , but thinks it fit
thus to bewitch thee for thy benefit
causing thy will to my wish to condescend
ABBA
for witches which some murder do intend
do make a picture and do shoot at it
and in that part where they the picture hit
the party 's self doth languish to his end
ABBA
so love , too weak by force thy heart to taint
within my heart thy heavenly shape doth paint
suffering therein his arrows to abide
only to th'end he might by witches ’ art
AABB
impetuous steams in spiral colums rise
through rifted rocks , impatient for the skies
or o'er bright seas of bubbling lavas blow
180 as heave and toss the billowy fires below
AABB
condensed on high , in wandering rills they glide
from maffon 's dome , and burst his sparry side
round his grey towers , and down his fringed walls
from cliff to cliff , the liquid treasure falls
AABB
woe to mine eyes , the organs of mine ill
hate to my heart , for not concealing joy
a double curse upon my tongue be still
whose babbling lost what else i might enjoy
ABAB
when first mine eyes did with thy beauty joy
they to my heart thy wondrous virtues told
who , fearing lest thy beams should him destroy
whate'er he knew , did to my tongue unfold
ABAB
my tell tale tongue , in talking over bold
what they in private council did declare
to thee , in plain and public terms unrolled
and so by that made thee more coyer far
ABAB
if that my sensual deed had stol'n from thee
aught that were part of thy most precious love
or made to swerve the loving soul of me
that to thy service it should duller prove
ABAB
had't made to me thy grace less gracious seem
thy worth less worth , thy love a smaller prize
or bated aught of thy most rich esteem
which still grew richer in thy servant 's eyes
ABAB
then were it fault too foul to find excuse
and all i writ of thee were vows untrue
my verse were nought but idle poet 's use
conceit 's worn weeds lac 'd o'er with wording new
ABAB
“ beloved vale ! ” i said , “ when i shall con
those many records of my childish years
remembrance of myself and of my peers
will press me down : to think of what is gone
ABBA
will be an awful thought , if life have one
but , when into the vale i came , no fears
distress 'd me ; i look 'd round , i shed no tears
deep thought , or awful vision , i had none
ABBA
by thousand petty fancies i was cross 'd
to see the trees , which i had thought so tall
mere dwarfs ; the brooks so narrow , fields so small
a juggler 's balls old time about him toss 'd
ABBA
“ you know , you dogs , your master long has felt
a keen distemper in the royal pelt
a testy , superficial irritation
brought home , i fancy , from some foreign nation
AABB
for this a thousand simples you 've prescribed
unguents external , draughts to be imbibed
you 've plundered scotland of its plants , the seas
you 've ravished , and despoiled the hebrides
AABB
to brew me remedies which , in probation
were sovereign only in their application
in vain , and eke in pain , have i applied
your flattering unctions to my soul and hide
AABB
as one of some fat tillage dispossessed
weighing the yield of these four faded years
if any ask what fruit seems loveliest
what lasting gold among the garnered ears
ABAB
ah , then i 'll say what hours i had of thine
therein i reaped time 's richest revenue
read in thy text the sense of david 's line
through thee achieved the love that shakespeare knew
ABAB
take then his book , laden with mine own love
as flowers made sweeter by deep drunken rain
that when years sunder and between us move
wide waters , and less kindly bonds constrain
ABAB
he 's a worker of magic and wonderful wise
he cries when he laughs and he laughs when he cries
he sweats when he 's cold , and he shivers when hot
and the water is cold in his boiling pot
AABB
he hides in the earth and he walks in disguise
but he loves the brave and their sacrifice
we are sons of hey ó ka . the giant commands
in the boiling water to thrust our hands
AABB
thou wouldst have led us through the twilight land
where spirit shows by form , form is refined
away to spirit by transfiguring mind
till they are one , and in the morn we stand
ABBA
treading thy footsteps , children , hand in hand
with sense divinely growing , till , combined
we heard the music of the planets wind
in harmony with billows on the strand
ABBA
so is it with this singing art of ours
that once with maids went maidenlike , and played
with woven dances in the poplar shade
and all her song was but of lady 's bowers
ABBA
and the returning swallows , and spring flowers
till forth to seek a shadow queen she strayed
a shadowy land ; and now hath overweighed
her singing chaplet with the snow and showers
ABBA
i writ how once i wander 'd from thy side
serving the strong suggestions of my blood
only to prove from worse things vainly tried
how far more precious grew thy sum of good
ABAB
if i so lov 'd thee , what is my defence
that thy dear love fail 'd then my steps to stay
that idle hours were idly given to sense
and soul forsaken at the call of clay
ABAB
o let love grant excuse ; my sensual part
dwelt ever far from pure untainted thee
it held no conversation with my heart
nor , us 'd or check 'd , could be thine injury
ABAB
vanguard of liberty , ye men of kent
ye children of a soil that doth advance
it 's haughty brow against the coast of france
now is the time to prove your hardiment
ABBA
to france be words of invitation sent
they from their fields can see the countenance
of your fierce war , may ken the glittering lance
and hear you shouting forth your brave intent
ABBA
left single , in bold parley , ye , of yore
did from the norman win a gallant wreath
confirm 'd the charters that were yours before
no parleying now ! in britain is one breath
ABAB
the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts
and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts
at this , the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook
a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look
AABB
she sees , and trembles at th ’ approaching ill
just in the jaws of ruin , and codille
and now ( as oft in some distempered state
on one nice trick depends the general fate
AABB
an ace of hearts steps forth : the king unseen
lurked in her hand , and mourned his captive queen
he springs to vengeance with an eager pace
and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace
AABB
thus raged both armies like conflicting fires
while nestor ’ s chariot far from fight retires
his coursers steep ’ d in sweat , and stain ’ d with gore
the greeks ’ preserver , great machaon , bore
AABB
that hour achilles , from the topmost height
of his proud fleet , o ’ erlook ’ d the fields of fight
his feasted eyes beheld around the plain
the grecian rout , the slaying , and the slain
AABB
his friend machaon singled from the rest
a transient pity touch ’ d his vengeful breast
straight to menoetius ’ much loved son he sent
graceful as mars , patroclus quits his tent
AABB
i pray to be the tool which to your hand
long use has shaped and moulded till it be
apt for your need , and , unconsideringly
you take it for its service . i demand
ABBA
to be forgotten in the woven strand
which grows the multi coloured tapestry
of your bright life , and through its tissues lie
a hidden , strong , sustaining , grey toned band
ABBA
i wish to dwell around your daylight dreams
the railing to the stairway of the clouds
to guard your steps securely up , where streams
a faery moonshine washing pale the crowds
ABAB
“ griev ’ st thou for me , or for , my martial band
or come sad tidings from our native land
our fathers live ( our first , most tender care
thy good menoetius breathes the vital air
AABB
and hoary peleus yet extends his days
pleased in their age to hear their children ’ s praise
or may some meaner cause thy pity claim
perhaps yon relics of the grecian name
AABB
doom ’ d in their ships to sink by fire and sword
and pay the forfeit of their haughty lord
whate ’ er the cause , reveal thy secret care
and speak those sorrows which a friend would share
AABB
was it the moon , or was it morning 's ray
that call 'd thee , dearest , from these arms away
scarce hadst thou left me , when a dream of night
came o'er my spirit so distinct and bright
AABB
that , while i yet can vividly recall
its witching wonders , thou shall hear them all
methought i saw , upon the lunar beam
two winged boys , such as thy muse might dream
AABB
descending from above , at that still hour
and gliding , with smooth step , into my bower
fair as the beauteous spirits that , all day
in amatha 's warm founts imprisoned stay
AABB
i see gray teachers ,— on their work intent
their lavished lives , in endless labor spent
had closed at last in age and penury wrecked
martyrs , not burned , but frozen in neglect
AABB
save for the generous hands that stretched in aid
of worn out servants left to die half paid
ah , many a year will pass , i thought , ere we
such kindly forethought shall rejoice to see
AABB
monarchs are mindful of the sacred debt
that cold republics hasten to forget
i see the priest ,— if such a name he bears
who without pride his sacred vestment wears
AABB
and for anchises ’ sake old daunus save
or , if thy vow 'd revenge pursue my death
give to my friends my body void of breath
the latian chiefs have seen me beg my life
ABBA
then did a sharped spyre of diamond bright
ten feete each way in square , appeare to mee
iustly proportion 'd up unto his hight
so far as archer might his level see
ABAB
upon foure corners of the base were pight
to beare the frame , foure great lyons of gold
a worthy tombe for such a worthy wight
alas ! this world doth nought but grievance hold
ABAB
o wholesome death , thy sombre funeral car
looms ever dimly on the lengthening way
of life ; while , lengthening still , in sad array
my deeds in long procession go , that are
ABBA
as mourners of the man they helped to mar
i see it all in dreams , such as waylay
the wandering fancy when the solid day
has fallen in smoldering ruins , and night 's star
ABBA
aloft there , with its steady point of light
mastering the eye , has wrapped the brain in sleep
ah , when i die , and planets take their flight
above my grave , still let my spirit keep
ABAB
eventful volume ! whatsoe'er the change
of scene and clime — the adventures bold and strange
the griefs — the frailties but too frankly told
the loves , the feuds thy pages may unfold
AABB
if truth with half so prompt a hand unlocks
his virtues as his failings , we shall find
the record there of friendships held like rocks
and enmities like sun touched snow resigned
ABAB
of fealty , cherisht without change or chill
in those who served him , young , and serve him still
of generous aid given , with that noiseless art
which wakes not pride , to many a wounded heart
AABB
if heav'n a date of many years wou 'd give
thus i 'd in pleasure , ease and plenty live
and as i near approach 'd the verge of life
some kind relation ( for i 'd have no wife
AABB
should take upon him all my worldly care
while i did for a better state prepare
then i 'd not be with any trouble vext
nor have the evening of my days perplext
AABB
but by a silent , and a peaceful death
without a sigh , resign my aged breath
and when committed to the dust , i 'd have
few tears , but friendly drop 'd into my grave
AABB
yet , ‘ midst the blaze of courts , she fix 'd her love
on the cool fountain , or the shady grove
still , with the shepherd 's innocence , her mind
to the sweet vale , and flowery mead , inclined
AABB
and oft as spring renew 'd the plains with flowers
breathed his soft gales , and led the fragrant hours
with sure return she sought the sylvan scene
the breezy mountains , and the forests green
AABB
her maids around her moved , a duteous band
each bore a crook , all rural , in her hand
some simple lay , of flocks and herds , they sung
with joy the mountain and the forest rung
AABB
we wander on through life as pilgrims do
o'er trackless deserts to a distant shrine
weary and parch 'd , and to our longing view
springs many a false mirage of joy divine
ABAB
that fades before us as we fain pursue
the empty picture which our fancy drew
o thou , my heart ! seek not the empty shows
and gilded nothings of this little time
AABB
the heroes of the present and the past
were puny , vague , and nothingness to thee
thou didst a span grasp mighty to the last
and strain for glory when thy die was cast
AABB
of heroes ; and , as looking at the sun
so gazing on thy greatness , made men blind
to merits , that had adoration won
in olden times . the world was on thy page
ABAB
in the dim chamber whence but yesterday
passed my belov è d , filled with awe i stand
and haunting loves fluttering on every hand
whisper her praises who is far away
ABBA
a thousand delicate fancies glance and play
on every object which her robes have fanned
and tenderest thoughts and hopes bloom and expand
in the sweet memory of her beauty 's ray
ABBA
ah ! could that glass but hold the faintest trace
of all the loveliness once mirrored there
the clustering glory of the shadowy hair
that framed so well the dear young angel face
ABBA
xv . as he that parts in hatred from a friend
mixing with other men forgets the woe
which anguished him when he beheld and lo
two souls had fled asunder which did bend
ABBA
under the same blue heaven ! yet ere the end
when the loud world hath tossed him to and fro
will often strangely reappear that glow
at simplest memory which some chance may send
ABBA
although much stronger bonds have lost their power
so thou god sent didst come in lowly guise
striking on simple chords ,— not with surprise
or mightiest recollectings in that hour
ABBA
became a harp whereon his voice and mood
made spheral music round his haloed head
i spake — for then i had not long been dead
“ let me look round upon the vasts , and brood
ABBA
a moment on these orbs ere i decide
what is yon lower star that beauteous shines
and with soft splendour now incarnadines
our wings ? — there would i go and there abide
ABBA
the matron woo 'd her kindness to the last
but could not win ; her hour of grace was past
whom , thus persisting , when she could not bring
to leave the wolf , and to believe her king
AABB
the panther ask 'd what concord there could be
betwixt two kinds whose natures disagree
the dame replied : ‘ tis sung in every street
the common chat of gossips when they meet
AABB
the hero turn 'd to greet the novel sight
when three far splendors , yet confusedly bright
rose like a constellation ; till more near
distinctly mark 'd their different sites appear
AABB
diverging still , beneath their roofs of gold
three cities gay their mural towers unfold
so , led by visions of his guiding god
the seer of patmos o'er the welkin trod
AABB
saw the new heaven its flamy cope unbend
and walls and gates and spiry domes descend
his well known sacred city grows , and gains
her new built towers , her renovated fanes
AABB
to her the youth . “ we reach 'd the pylian plains
where nestor , shepherd of his people , reigns
all arts of tenderness to him are known
kind to ulysses ’ race as to his own
AABB
no father with a fonder grasp of joy
strains to his bosom his long absent boy
but all unknown , if yet ulysses breathe
or glide a spectre in the realms beneath
AABB
for farther search , his rapid steeds transport
my lengthen 'd journey to the spartan court
there argive helen i beheld , whose charms
( so heaven decreed ) engaged the great in arms
AABB
the generous greeks recede with tardy pace
though mars and hector thunder in their face
none turn their backs to mean ignoble flight
slow they retreat , and even retreating fight
AABB
who first , who last , by mars ’ and hector ’ s hand
stretch ’ d in their blood , lay gasping on the sand
tenthras the great , orestes the renown ’ d
for managed steeds , and trechus press ’ d the ground
AABB
next oenomaus and oenops ’ offspring died
oresbius last fell groaning at their side
oresbius , in his painted mitre gay
in fat boeotia held his wealthy sway
AABB
hail english swan ? for you alone could dare
with well pois 'd pinions tempt th ’ unbounded air
and to your lute pindaric numbers call
nor fear the danger of a threatned fall
AABB
o had you liv 'd to waller 's reverend age
better 'd your measures , and reform 'd your page
then britain 's isle might raise her trophies high
and solid rome , or witty greece outvy
AABB
the rhine , the tyber , and parisian sein
when e 're they pay their tribute to the main
should no sweet song more willingly rehearse
than gentle cowley 's never dying verse
AABB
i sacrifice my youth and blooming years
at her proud feet , and she respects not it
my flower , untimely 's withered with my tears
by winter woes for spring of youth unfit
ABAB
she thinks a look may recompense my care
and so with looks prolongs my long looked ease
as short that bliss , so is the comfort rare
yet must that bliss my hungry thoughts appease
ABAB
one night , when i came home unusual late
too hungry and too tired to feel first rate
her supper struck me wrong ( though i 'll allow
she had n't much to strike with , anyhow
AABB
and when i went to milk the cows , and found
they 'd wandered from their usual feeding ground
and maybe 'd left a few long miles behind ‘ em
which i must copy , if i meant to find ‘ em
AABB
flash quick the stay chains of my temper broke
and in a , trice these hot words i had spoke
“ you ought to 've kept the animals in view
and drove ‘ em in ; you 'd nothing else to do
AABB
fayre cruell ! why are ye so fierce and cruell
is it because your eyes have powre to kill
then know that mercy is the mighties iewell
and greater glory think to save then spill
ABAB
but if it be your pleasure and proud will
to shew the powre of your imperious eyes
then not on him that never thought you ill
but bend your force against your enemyes
ABAB
let them feel the utmost of your crueltyes
and kill with looks , as cockatrices do
but him that at your footstoole humbled lies
with mercifull regard give mercy to
ABAB
for , sooth to say , the swallow brought him in
her household chaplain , and her next of kin
in superstition silly to excess
and casting schemes by planetary guess
AABB
i know not why , but all this weary day
suggested by no definite grief or pain
sad fancies have been flitting through my brain
now it has been a vessel losing way
ABBA
rounding a stormy headland ; now a gray
dull waste of clouds above a wintry main
and then , a banner , drooping in the rain
and meadows beaten into bloody clay
ABBA
strolling at random with this shadowy woe
at heart , i chanced to wander hither ! lo
a league of desolate marsh land , with its lush
hot grasses in a noisome , tide left bed
AABB
the isteian fields for generous vines renown ’ d
the fair caristos , and the styrian ground
where dios from her towers o ’ erlooks the plain
and high cerinthus views the neighbouring main
AABB
down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair
their hands dismiss not the long lance in air
but with protended spears in fighting fields
pierce the tough corslets and the brazen shields
AABB
so oft as homeward i from her depart
i go lyke one that , having lost the field
is prisoner led away with heavy hart
despoyld of warlike armes and knowen shield
ABAB
there let no thought of ioy , or pleasure vaine
dare to approch , that may my solace breed
bet sudden * dumps **, and drery sad disdayne
of all worlds gladnesse , more my torment feed
ABAB
soon as the prince appears without the gate
the volscians , with their virgin leader , wait
his last commands . then , with a graceful mien
lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen
AABB
her squadron imitates , and each descends
whose common suit camilla thus commends
“ if sense of honor , if a soul secure
of inborn worth , that can all tests endure
AABB
can promise aught , or on itself rely
greatly to dare , to conquer or to die
then , i alone , sustain 'd by these , will meet
the tyrrhene troops , and promise their defeat
AABB
for sunday 's play he never makes excuse
but plays at taw , and buys his spanish juice
hard as his toil , and ever slow to speak
yet he gives maidens many a burning cheek
AABB
for none can pass him but his witless grace
of bawdry brings the blushes in her face
as vulgar as the dirt he treads upon
he calls his cows or drives his horses on
AABB
he knows the lamest cow and strokes her side
and often tries to mount her back and ride
and takes her tail at night in idle play
and makes her drag him homeward all the way
AABB
oh ! might these sighs and tears return again
into my breast and eyes which i have spent
that i might , in this holy discontent
mourn with some fruit , as i have mourned in vain
ABBA
in mine idolatry what showers of rain
mine eyes did waste ! what griefs my heart did rent
that sufferance was my sin i now repent
‘ cause i did suffer , i must suffer pain
ABBA
the hydroptic drunkard , and night scouting thief
the itchy lecher , and self tickling proud
have th ’ remembrance of past joys for relief
of coming ills . to poor me is allow 'd
ABAB
miracle of the world ! i never will deny
that former poets praise the beauty of their days
but all those beauties were but figures of thy praise
and all those poets did of thee but prophesy
ABBA
thy coming to the world hath taught us to descry
what petrarch 's laura meant , for truth the lip bewrays
lo , why th ’ italians , yet which never saw thy rays
to find out petrarch 's sense such forg è d glosses try
ABBA
cover thine eyes and weep , o child of hell
grey spouse of satan , church of name abhorred
weep , withered harlot , with thy weeping lord
now none will buy the heaven thou hast to sell
ABBA
at price of prostituted souls , and swell
thy loveless list of lovers . fire and sword
no more are thine : the steel , the wheel , the cord
the flames that rose round living limbs , and fell
ABBA
in lifeless ash and ember , now no more
approve thee godlike . rome , redeemed at last
from all the red pollution of thy past
acclaims the grave bright face that smiled of yore
ABBA
the castle gate stands open now
and the wanderer is welcome to the hall
as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough
no longer scowl the turrets tall
ABAB
the summer 's long siege at last is o'er
when the first poor outcast went in at the door
she entered with him in disguise
and mastered the fortress by surprise
AABB
there is no spot she loves so well on ground
she lingers and smiles there the whole year round
the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land
has hall and bower at his command
AABB
a graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve
venice and winter , hand in deadly hand
have slain the lover of her sunbright strand
and singer of a stormbright christmas eve
ABBA
a graceless guerdon we that loved receive
for all our love , from that the dearest land
love worshipped ever . blithe and soft and bland
too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave
ABBA
shone on our dreams and memories evermore
the domes , the towers , the mountains and the shore
that gird or guard thee , venice : cold and black
seems now the face we loved as he of yore
ABAB
when i perceive love 's heavenly reaping still
regard perforce the clouds ’ vicissitude
that the fixed spirit loves not when it will
but craves its seasons of the flawful blood
ABAB
when i perceive that the high poet doth
oft voiceless stray beneath the uninfluent stars
that even urania of her kiss is loath
and song 's brave wings fret on their sensual bars
ABAB
when i perceived the fullest sail ed sprite
lag at most need upon the leth ed seas
the provident captainship oft voided quite
and lam ed lie deep draughted argosies
ABAB
frown ever opposite , the angel cried
who , with an earthquake 's might and giant hand
severed these riven rocks , and bade them stand
severed for ever ! the vast ocean tide
ABBA
leaving its roar without at his command
shrank , and beneath the woods through the green land
went gently murmuring on , so to deride
the frowning barriers that its force defied
AABB
but art , high o'er the trailing smoke below
of sea bound steamer , on yon summit 's head
sat musing ; and where scarce a wandering crow
sailed o'er the chasm , in thought a highway led
ABAB
why is my verse so barren of new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside
to new found methods , and to compounds strange
ABAB
why write i still all one , ever the same
and keep invention in a noted weed
that every word doth almost tell my name
showing their birth , and where they did proceed
ABAB
o know sweet love i always write of you
and you and love are still my argument
so all my best is dressing old words new
spending again what is already spent
ABAB
but , flaccus , now more happy he appeares
who , with the burthen of his cares
farre off hath left his father ’ s ground , set free
from the fierce wrangling lawyer ’ s fee
AABB
no scorching heat , nor blasts of winter jove
doth hurt his fruit , or him can move
hee shuns all strifes , and never doth resort
the sinfull gates o ’ th ’ greedy court
AABB
but either doth bewayle those dayes and nights
lost by him in prophane delights
or else retyr ’ d , strives to collect and find
the dispers ’ d flock of ’ s wandring mind
AABB
a night , where darkness lays her chains and bars
and feral fires appear instead of stars
but he , along with the last looks of day
went hence , and setting — sunlike — pass 'd away
AABB
what future storms our present sins do hatch
some in the dark discern , and others watch
though foresight makes no hurricane prove mild
fury that 's long fermenting is most wild
AABB
but to return to our forlorn gallant
whose bosom for the lady 's ‘ gan to pant
he , to his doctor , not a word had said
now here , now there , he tried to pop his head
AABB
but neither door nor window could he find
where he might glimpse the object of his mind
or even hear her voice , or sound her name
no fortress had he ever found the same
AABB
yet still to conquer he was quite resolved
and oft the manner in his mind revolved
this plan at length he thought would best succeed
to execute it doubtless he had need
AABB
are those two stars , her eyes , my life 's light gone
by which my soul was fre è d from all dark
and am i left distressed to live alone
where none my tears and mournful tale shall mark
ABAB
ah sun , why shine thy looks , thy looks like gold
when horsemen brave thou risest in the east
ah cynthia pale , to whom my griefs i told
why do you both rejoice both man and beast
ABAB
and i alone , alone that dark possess
by licia 's absence brighter than the sun
whose smiling light did ease my sad distress
and broke the clouds , when tears like rain begun
ABAB
when jove a heav'n of small glass did behold
he smil 'd , and to the gods these words he told
“ comes then the power of man 's art to this
in a frail orb my work new acted is
AABB
the poles ’ decrees , the fate of things , god 's laws
down by his art old archimedes draws
spirits inclos 'd the sev'ral stars attend
and orderly the living work they bend
AABB
a feign è d zodiac measures out the year
ev'ry new month a false moon doth appear
and now bold industry is proud , it can
wheel round its world , and rule the stars by man
AABB
she back four paces drew , at first , through shame
then , led by love , eight others forward came
but scruples still arose that ardour foiled
and nearly ey'ry thing had truly spoiled
AABB
anne had a conscience pure as holy fire
but how could she abstain from soft desire
if , in the bosom chance a flame should raise
is there a pow'r can then subdue the blaze
AABB
at first these inclinations she withstood
but doubting soon , how those of flesh and blood
could sins commit by stepping in advance
she took her seat upon the green expanse
AABB
but now had hesper from the hero 's sight
veil 'd the vast world with sudden shades of night
earth , sea and heaven , where'er he turns his eye
arch out immense , like one surrounding sky
AABB
lamp 'd with reverberant fires . the starry train
paint their fresh forms beneath the placid main
fair cynthia here her face reflected laves
bright venus gilds again her natal waves
AABB
the bear redoubling foams with fiery joles
and two dire dragons twine two arctic poles
lights o'er the land , from cities lost in shade
new constellations , new galaxies spread
AABB
shall that of me that now contains the stars
be by the very contained stars survived
thus were fate all unjust . yet what truth bars
an all unjust fate ’ s truth from being believed
ABAB
conjecture cannot fit to the seen world
a garment of its thought untorn or covering
or with its stuffed garb forge an otherworld
without itself its dead deceit discovering
ABAB
accuse me thus , that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay
forgot upon your dearest love to call
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
ABAB
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
and given to time your own dear purchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight
ABAB
book both my wilfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise , accumulate
bring me within the level of your frown
but shoot not at me in your wakened hate
ABAB
faire blewe the wind into her bosome right
and th'heavens looked lovely all the while
that she did seeme to daunce , as in delight
and at her owne felicitie did smile
ABAB
o thou who dost know what the heart fain would hide
who ever art ready whate'er may betide
in whom the distressed can hope in their woe
whose ears with the groans of the wretched are plied
AABB
still bid thy good gifts from thy treasury flow
all good is assembled where thou dost abide
to thee , save my poverty , nought can i show
and of thee all my poverty 's wants are supplied
ABAB
what choice have i save to thy portal to go
if ‘ tis shut , to what other my steps can i guide
‘ fore whom as a suppliant low shall i bow
if thy bounty to me , thy poor slave , is denied
ABAB
cherish you then the hope i shall forget
at length , my lord , pieria ?— put away
for your so passing sake , this mouth of clay
these mortal bones against my body set
ABBA
for all the puny fever and frail sweat
of human love ,— renounce for these , i say
the singing mountain 's memory , and betray
the silent lyre that hangs upon me yet
ABBA
ah , but indeed , some day shall you awake
rather , from dreams of me , that at your side
so many nights , a lover and a bride
but stern in my soul 's chastity , have lain
ABBA
what matters that her multitudinous store
the garnered fruit of measureless desire
sank in the maelstrom of abysmal fire
to be of man beheld on earth no more
ABBA
her loyal children , cheery to the core
quailed not , nor blenched , while she , above the ire
of elemental ragings , dared aspire
on victory 's wings resplendently to soar
ABBA
in a false dream i saw the foe prevail
the war was ended ; the last smoke had rolled
away : and we , erewhile the strong and bold
stood broken , humbled , withered , weak and pale
ABBA
and moan 'd , “ our greatness is become a tale
to tell our children 's babes when we are old
they shall put by their playthings to be told
how england once , before the years of bale
ABBA
throned above trembling , puissant , grandiose , calm
held asia 's richest jewel in her palm
and with unnumbered isles barbaric , she
the broad hem of her glistering robe impearl 'd
AABB
eyes calm beside thee ( lady , could'st thou know
may turn away thick with fast gathering tears
i glance not where all gaze : thrilling and low
their passionate praises reach thee — my cheek wears
ABAB
alone no wonder when thou passest by
thy tremulous lids bent and suffused reply
to the irrepressible homage which doth glow
on every lip but mine : if in thine ears
AABB
their accents linger — and thou dost recall
me as i stood , still , guarded , very pale
beside each votarist whose lighted brow
wore worship like an aureole , “ o'er them all
ABBA
the learned teacher satisfaction showed
that such success from his instructions flowed
laughed heartily at husbands , silly wights
who had not wit to guard connubial rights
AABB
and from their lamb the wily wolf to keep
a shepherd will o'erlook a hundred sheep
while foolish man 's unable to protect
e'en one where most he 'd wish to be correct
AABB
howe'er , this care he thought was somewhat hard
but not a thing impossible to guard
and if he had not got a hundred eyes
thank heav'n , his wife , though cunning to devise
AABB
e'en i who speak , alas ! have troubles met
within my bosom oft i feel regret
three children ere my marriage i had got
have i your father told this secret blot
AABB
have we together been less happy found
the list'ner had no sooner heard the sound
but like a man distracted off he flew
the saddle 's girth , which hazard near him threw
AABB
he took and fastened tightly ‘ bout his waist
then bawled around and round with anxious haste
i 'm girth 'd ! d'ye see , completely taken in
the people stared , an ‘ gan to laugh and grin
AABB
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
finding thy worth a limit past my praise
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the time bettering days
ABAB
and do so love , yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
thou truly fair , wert truly sympathized
in true plain words , by thy true telling friend
ABAB
by four fond swains in playful circles drawn
on glowing wheels she tracks the moon bright lawn
mounts the rude cliff , unveils her blushing charms
230 and calls the panting zephyrs to her arms
AABB
emerged from ocean springs the vaporous air
bathes her light limbs , uncurls her amber hair
incrusts her beamy form with films saline
and beauty blazes through the crystal shrine
AABB
235 so with pellucid studs the ice flower gems
her rimy foliage , and her candied stems
so from his glassy horns , and pearly eyes
the diamond beetle darts a thousand dyes
AABB
the only bird alone that nature frames
when weary of the tedious life she lives
by fire dies , yet finds new life in flames
her ashes to her shape new essence gives
ABAB
when only i , the only wretched wight
weary of life that breathes but sorrow 's blast
pursue the flame of such a beauty bright
that burns my heart , and yet my life still lasts
ABAB
o sovereign light , that with thy sacred flame
consumes my life , revive me after this
and make me , with the happy bird , the same
that dies to live , by favour of thy bliss
ABAB
if so it hap this offspring of my care
these fatal anthems , lamentable songs
come to their view , who like afflicted are
let them yet sigh their own , and moan my wrongs
ABAB
but untouched hearts with unaffected eye
approach not to behold my soul 's distress
clear sighted you soon note what is awry
whilst blinded souls mine errors never guess
ABAB
you blinded souls , whom youth and error lead
you outcast eaglets dazzled with your sun
do you , and none but you , my sorrows read
you best can judge the wrongs that she hath done
ABAB
we bowled along the pleasant country lanes
by wooded heights and blossom covered plains
see ! said he , there 's my house among the trees
sheltered , yet open to the southern breeze
AABB
in that beyond , with other two , you see
whose grounds close round my own so pleasantly
live valued friends of whom i never tire
with each abode a telegraphic wire
AABB
communicates , so , when we feel inclined
for whist or billiards , after we have dined
we telegraph to fix the time and place
and oft arrange a meet for hunt and chase
AABB
as jove 's increase , who from his brain was born
whom arms and arts did equally adorn
free of the breast was bred , whose milky taste
minerva 's name to venus had debased
AABB
so this imperial babe rejects the food
that mixes monarch 's with plebeian blood
food that his inborn courage might control
extinguish all the father in his soul
AABB
and , for his estian race , and saxon strain
might reproduce some second richard 's reign
mildness he shares from both his parents ’ blood
but kings too tame are despicably good
AABB
— nor for myself nor any other . yet
i cannot but remember all that passed
since justice shook these bosoms , and the fret
of indignation stirred them and they cast
ABAB
forgot aside all lesser wrongs , and rose
against the spiritual evil of that threat
that made them of dishonour slaves or foes
and who may but with pride remember how
ABAB
not by ten righteous justice might be saved
but by unsaintly millions moving all
as the tide moves when myriad tossed waves flow
one way , and on the crumbling bastions fall
ABAB
within this wood , out of a rock did rise
a spring of water , mildly rumbling down
whereto approached not in any wise
the homely shepherd nor the ruder clown
ABAB
but many muses and the nymphs withal
but while herein i took my chief delight
i saw ( alas !) the gaping earth devour
the spring , the place , and all clean out of sight
ABAB
the swift assailants still no fire return
but , tow'rd the batteries that above them burn
climb hard from crag to crag ; and scaling higher
they pierce the long dense canopy of fire
AABB
that sheeted all the sky ; then rush amain
storm every outwork , each dread summit gain
hew timber 'd gates , the sullen drawbridge fall
file thro and form within the sounding wall
AABB
the britons strike their flag , the fort forgo
descend sad prisoners to the plain below
a thousand veterans , ere the morning rose
received their handcuffs from five hundred foes
AABB
some time ago from rome , in smart array
a younger brother homeward bent his way
not much improved , as frequently the case
with those who travel to that famous place
AABB
upon the road oft finding , where he stayed
delightful wines , and handsome belle or maid
with careless ease he loitered up and down
one day there passed him in a country town
AABB
attended by a page , a lady fair
whose charming form and all engaging air
at once his bosom fired with fond desire
and nearer still , her beauties to admire
AABB
sweet cytherea , sitting by a brook
with young adonis , lovely , fresh , and green
did court the lad with many a lovely look
such looks as none could look but beauty 's queen
ABAB
“ so speaking , from the ruddy orient shone
the morn , conspicuous on her golden throne
the goddess with a radiant tunic dress 'd
my limbs , and o'er me cast a silken vest
AABB
long flowing robes , of purest white , array
the nymph , that added lustre to the day
a tiar wreath 'd her head with many a fold
her waist was circled with a zone of gold
AABB
forth issuing then , from place to place i flew
rouse man by man , and animate my crew
‘ rise , rise , my mates ! ‘ tis circe gives command
our journey calls us ; haste , and quit the land
AABB
the prioress , this secret to disclose
appeared with spectacles upon her nose
and twenty nuns around a dress displayed
that convent mantua makers never made
AABB
imagine to yourself what felt the youth
‘ mid this examination of the truth
the nice proportions and the lily charms
soon raised within his bosom dire alarms
AABB
like magick operated on the string
and from it , what was tied , soon gave a spring
broke loose at once , just like a mettled steed
that , having slipt its halter , flies with speed
AABB
thou poetess ! that harpest to the moon
and , in soft concert to the silver tune
of waters , play 'd on by the magic wind
as he comes streaming , with his hair untwined
AABB
dost sing light strains of melody and mirth
i hear thee , hymning on thy holy birth
how thou wert moulded of thy mother love
that came , like seraph , from the stars above
AABB
and was so sadly wedded unto sin
that thou wert born , and sorrow was thy twin
sorrow and mirthful lunacy ! that be
together link 'd for time , i deem of ye
AABB
the grecian muse has all their gods survived
nor jove at us , nor phoebus is arrived
frail deities ! which first the poets made
and then invoked , to give their fancies aid
AABB
yet if they still divert us with their rage
what may be hoped for in a better age
when not from helicon 's imagined spring
but sacred writ , we borrow what we sing
AABB
this with the fabric of the world begun
elder than light , and shall outlast the sun
before this oracle , like dagon , all
the false pretenders , delphos , ammon , fall
AABB
yet grace , if thou repent , thou canst not lack
but who shall give thee that grace to begin
oh ! make thyself with holy mourning black
and red with blushing , as thou art with sin
ABAB
returning from its daily quest , my spirit
changed thoughts and vile in thee doth weep to find
it grieves me that thy mild and gentle mind
those ample virtues which it did inherit
ABBA
has lost . once thou didst loathe the multitude
of blind and madding men — i then loved thee
i loved thy lofty songs and that sweet mood
when thou wert faithful to thyself and me
ABAB
fayre , when her brest , lyke a rich laden barke
with pretious merchandize she forth doth lay
fayre , when that cloud of pryde , which oft doth dark
her goodly light , with smiles she drives away
ABAB
but fayrest she , when so she doth display
the gate with pearles and rubyes richly dight
throgh which her words so wise do make their way
to beare the message of her gentle spright
ABAB
already , if my mem'ry do not fail
i 've said , the youth 's estates were put to sale
to pay for feasts the fair to entertain
and what he 'd left was only one domain
AABB
a petty farm to which he now retired
ashamed to show where once so much admired
and wretched too , a prey to lorn despair
unable to obtain by splendid care
AABB
a beauty he 'd pursued six years and more
and should for ever fervently adore
his want of merit was the cause he thought
that she could never to his wish be brought
AABB
little miss baster , of sunnyside
was known as a taster , far and wide
picking and licking , spying and prying
each bottle and dish with her fingers trying
AABB
harmless she deems it , yes , she must taste
like sugar seems it , ah ! but ‘ tis paste
rat'shyppphenbane , the mixture . oh ! woe the day
run for the doctor , bid him not stay
AABB
some ease at least those pious rites may give
and soothe my sorrows , while i bear to live
howe ’ er , reluctant as i am , i stay
and share your feast ; but with the dawn of day
AABB
( o king of men !) it claims thy royal care
that greece the warrior ’ s funeral pile prepare
and bid the forests fall : ( such rites are paid
to heroes slumbering in eternal shade
AABB
louder and louder still the awful roar
pealed from the heights , and shook the frightened shore
thick clouds of smoke enveloped friend and foe
the volleyed thunder shook the depths below
AABB
mountain and echoing forest joined the cry
and distant hills gave back the same reply
with animating voice and waving hand
the british leader cheered his gallant band
AABB
pressed firmly forward where one endless tide
of woe and carnage reigned on every side
where streams of blood in crimson torrents rolled
where death smote down alike the young and old
AABB
him thus inactive , with an ardent look
the prince beheld , and high resenting spoke
“ thy hate to troy , is this the time to show
( o wretch ill fated , and thy country ’ s foe
AABB
paris and greece against us both conspire
thy close resentment , and their vengeful ire
for thee great ilion ’ s guardian heroes fall
till heaps of dead alone defend her wall
AABB
for thee the soldier bleeds , the matron mourns
and wasteful war in all its fury burns
ungrateful man ! deserves not this thy care
our troops to hearten , and our toils to share
AABB
thus i the time with expectation spend
and faine my griefe with chaunges to beguile
that further seemes his terme still to extend
and maketh every minute seem a myle
ABAB
all woes of all men sat upon thy soul
and all their wrongs were heavy on thy head
with all their wounds thy heart was pierced and bled
and in thy spirit as in a mourning scroll
ABBA
the world 's huge sorrows were inscribed by roll
all theirs on earth who serve and faint for bread
all banished men 's , all theirs in prison dead
thy love had heart and sword hand for the whole
ABBA
“ this was my day of glory , ” didst thou say
when , by the scaffold thou hadst hope to climb
for thy faith 's sake , they brought thee respite ; “ nay
i shall not die then , i have missed my day
AABB
whilst i alone did call upon thy aid
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
but now my gracious numbers are decayed
and my sick muse doth give an other place
ABAB
i grant ( sweet love ) thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of , and pays it thee again
ABAB
which are the clouds , and which the mountains ? see
they mix and melt together ! yon blue hill
looks fleeting as the vapors which distill
their dews upon its summit , while the free
ABBA
and far off clouds , now solid , dark , and still
an aspect wear of calm eternity
each seems the other , as our fancies will
the cloud a mount , the mount a cloud , and we
ABAB
gaze doubtfully . so everywhere on earth
this foothold where we stand with slipping feet
the unsubstantial and substantial meet
and we are fooled until made wise by time
ABBA
“ by what wild passion , furious ! art thou toss ’ d
striv ’ st thou with jove ? thou art already lost
shall not the thunderer ’ s dread command restrain
and was imperial juno heard in vain
AABB
back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven
and in thy guilt involve the host of heaven
ilion and greece no more should jove engage
the skies would yield an ampler scene of rage
AABB
guilty and guiltless find an equal fate
and one vast ruin whelm the olympian state
cease then thy offspring ’ s death unjust to call
heroes as great have died , and yet shall fall
AABB
if cross 'd with all mishaps be my poor life
if one short day i never spent in mirth
if my sp'rit with itself holds lasting strife
if sorrow 's death is but new sorrow 's birth
ABAB
if this vain world be but a mournful stage
where slave born man plays to the scoffing stars
if youth be toss 'd with love , with weakness age
if knowledge serves to hold our thoughts in wars
ABAB
if time can close the hundred mouths of fame
and make what 's long since past , like that 's to be
if virtue only be an idle name
if being born i was but born to die
ABAB
love held me one and twenty years enchain 'd
his flame was joy — for hope was in my grief
for ten more years i wept without relief
when laura with my heart , to heaven attain 'd
ABBA
now weary grown , my life i had arraign 'd
that in its error , check 'd ( to my belief
blest virtue 's seeds now , in my yellow leaf
i grieve the mispent years , existence stain 'd
ABBA
alas ! it might have sought a brighter goal
in flying troublous thoughts , and winning peace
o father ! i repentant seek thy throne
thou , in this temple hast enshrined my soul
ABBA
— on all the desolations he hath wrought
— on all the passioned hatreds he hath taught
— on all thy great hopes he hath brought to nought
— man rending man with ruthless bitterness
AABB
— blasting thine image into nothingness
— hounding thy innocents to awful deaths
and worse than deaths ! happy the dead , who sped
before the torturers their lust had fed
AABB
— on thy christ crucified afresh each day
— on all the horrors of war 's grim red way
and ever , in thy solemn midnight skies
those myriad , sleepless , vast accusing eyes
AABB
tonight a shimmer of gold lies mantled o'er
smooth lovely ocean . through the lustrous gloom
a savor steals from linden trees in bloom
and gardens ranged at many a palace door
ABBA
proud walls rise here , and , where the moonbeams pour
their pale enchantment down the dim coast line
terrace and lawn , trim hedge and flowering vine
crown with fair culture all the sounding shore
ABBA
how sweet , to such a place , on such a night
from halls with beauty and festival a glare
to come distract and , stretched on the cool turf
yield to some fond , improbable delight
ABBA
‘ one caution yet is needful to be told
to guide your choice : this wife must not be old
there goes a saying , and ‘ twas shrewdly said
old fish at table , but young flesh in bed
AABB
my soul abhors the tasteless dry embrace
of a stale virgin with a winter face
in that cold season love but treats his guest
with beanstraw , and tough forage at the best
AABB
no crafty widows shall approach my bed
those are too wise for bachelors to wed
as subtle clerks by many schools are made
twice married dames are mistresses o ’ th ’ trade
AABB
o wholesome death , thy sombre funeral car
looms ever dimly on the lengthening way
of life ; while , lengthening still , in sad array
my deeds in long procession go , that are
ABBA
as mourners of the man they helped to mar
i see it all in dreams , such as waylay
the wandering fancy when the solid day
has fallen in smoldering ruins , and night 's star
ABBA
aloft there , with its steady point of light
mastering the eye , has wrapped the brain in sleep
ah , when i die , and planets hold their flight
above my grave , still let my spirit keep
ABAB
at threescore years and five aroused anew
to rule in india , forth a soldier went
on whose bright fronted youth fierce war had spent
its iron stress of storm , till glory grew
ABBA
and wrote as one rejoicing to record
that “ from the first ” his royal heart was lord
of its own pride or pain ; that thought was none
therein save this , that in her perilous strait
AABB
ah pale and dying infant of the spring
how rightly now do i resemble thee
that selfsame hand that thee from stalk did wring
hath rent my breast and robbed my heart from me
ABAB
the ravished sighs that ceaseless take their issue
from out the furnace of my heart inflamed
to yield you lasting springs shall never miss you
so by my plaints and pains , you shall be famed
ABAB
“ arise , depart , for this is not your rest
oh , burden of all burdens ,— still to arise
and still depart , nor rest in any wise
rolling , still rolling thus to east from west
ABBA
earth journeys on her immemorial quest
whom a moon chases in no different guise
thus stars pursue their courses , and thus flies
the sun , and thus all creatures manifest
ABBA
unrest , the common heritage , the ban
flung broadcast on all humankind ,— on all
who live ; for living , all are bound to die
that which is old , we know that it is man
ABBA
not marble , nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone , besmeared with sluttish time
ABAB
‘ gainst death , and all oblivious enmity
shall you pace forth , your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
ABAB
as now the perfum 'd lamps stream wide their light
and social converse chears the livelong night
thus spake zorobabel , “ too long in vain
“ for sion desolate her sons complain
AABB
“ in anguish worn the joyless years lag slow
“ and these proud conquerors mock their captive 's woe
“ whilst cyrus triumph 'd here in victor state
“ a brighter prospect chear 'd our exil 'd fate
AABB
“ our sacred walls again he bade us raise
“ and to jehovah rear the pile of praise
“ quickly these fond hopes faded from our eyes
“ as the frail sun that gilds the wintry skies
AABB
yet , lady , no — for song so rude as mine
chase not the wonders of your art divine
still , radiant eye , upon the canvas dwell
still , magic finger , weave your potent spell
AABB
and , while i sing the animated smiles
of fairy nature in these sun born isles
oh , might the song awake some bright design
inspire a touch , or prompt one happy line
AABB
proud were my soul , to see its humble thought
on painting 's mirror so divinely caught
while wondering genius , as he leaned to trace
the faint conception kindling into grace
AABB
i live , sweet love , whereas the gentle wind
murmurs with sport in midst of thickest boughs
where loving woodbine doth the harbor bind
and chirping birds do echo forth my vows
ABAB
where strongest elm can scarce support the vine
and sweetest flowers enameled have the ground
where muses dwell ; and yet hereat repine
that on the earth so rare a place was found
ABAB
but winds delight , i wish to be content
i praise the woodbine , but i take no joy
i moan the birds that music thus have spent
as for the rest , they breed but mine annoy
ABAB
when my abodes prefixed time is spent
my cruell fayre streight bids me wend my way
but then from heaven most hideous stormes are sent
as willing me against her will to stay
ABAB
whom then shall i — or heaven , or her — obay
the heavens know best what is the best for me
but as she will , whose will my life doth sway
my lower heaven , so it perforce must be
ABAB
but ye high hevens , that all this sorowe see
sith all your tempests cannot hold me backe
aswage your storms , or else both you and she
will both together me too sorely wrack
ABAB
dame fortune often loves a laugh to raise
and , playing off her tricks and roguish ways
instead of giving us what we desire
mere quid pro quo permits us to acquire
AABB
i 've found her gambols such from first to last
and judge the future by experience past
fair cloris and myself felt mutual flame
and , when a year had run , the sprightly dame
AABB
prepared to grant me , if i may be plain
some slight concessions that would ease my pain
this was her aim ; but whatsoe'er in view
‘ tis opportunity we should pursue
AABB
to love and to remember ; that is good
to love and to forget ; that is not well
to lapse from love to hatred ; that is hell
and death and torment , rightly understood
ABBA
soul dazed by love and sorrow , cheer thy mood
more blest art thou than mortal tongue can tell
ring not thy funeral but thy marriage bell
and salt with hope thy life 's insipid food
ABBA
love is the goal , love is the way we wend
love is our parallel unending line
whose only perfect parallel is christ
beginning not begun , end without end
ABBA
peace hath an altar there . the sounding feet
of thunder and the ‘ wildering wings of rain
against fire rifted summits flash and beat
and through grey upper gorges swoop and strain
ABAB
but round that hallowed mountain spring remain
year after year , the days of tender heat
and gracious nights , whose lips with flowers are sweet
and filtered lights , and lutes of soft refrain
ABBA
a still , bright pool . to men i may not tell
the secret that its heart of water knows
the story of a loved and lost repose
yet this i say to cliff and close leaved dell
ABBA
o thou ! whose steps in sacred reverence tread
these lone dominions of the silent dead
on this sad stone a pious look bestow
nor uninstructed read this tale of woe
AABB
and while the sigh of sorrow heaves thy breast
let each rebellious murmur be suppress 'd
heaven 's hidden ways to trace , for us how vain
heaven 's wise decrees , how impious to arraign
AABB
pure from the stains of a polluted age
in early bloom of life they left the stage
not doom 'd in lingering woe to waste their breath
one moment snatch 'd them from the power of death
AABB
yet why , you ask , these humble crimes relate
why make the poor as guilty as the great
to show the great , those mightier sons of pride
how near in vice the lowest are allied
AABB
such are their natures and their passions such
but these disguise too little , those too much
so shall the man of power and pleasure see
in his own slave as vile a wretch as he
AABB
in his luxurious lord the servant find
his own low pleasures and degenerate mind
and each in all the kindred vices trace
of a poor , blind , bewildered , erring race
AABB
upon a rock , high on a mountain side
thousands of feet above the lake sea 's lip
a rock in which old waters ’ rise and dip
plunge and recoil , and backward eddying tide
ABBA
had , age long , worn , while races lived and died
involved channels , where the sea weed 's drip
followed the ebb ; and now earth grasses sip
fresh dews from heaven , whereby on earth they bide
ABBA
i sat and gazed southwards . a dry flow
of withering wind blew on my drooping strength
from o'er the awful desert 's burning length
behind me piled , away and upward go
ABBA
by day she woos me , soft , exceeding fair
but all night as the moon so changeth she
loathsome and foul with hideous leprosy
and subtle serpents gliding in her hair
ABBA
by day she woos me to the outer air
ripe fruits , sweet flowers , and full satiety
but through the night , a beast she grins at me
a very monster void of love and prayer
ABBA
by day she stands a lie : by night she stands
in all the naked horror of the truth
with pushing horns and clawed and clutching hands
is this a friend indeed ; that i should sell
ABAB
angel of thought , meseems god winged thee so
and crowned thine head with passion fine as flame
and made thy lifted face too pure for shame
with eyes and brow a mirror to his glow
ABBA
and gave thy lips a golden trump , that , though
long years have passed since other angels came
to work the mighty wonders of his name
in god 's own name and man 's , thyself shalt go
ABBA
forever on strong pinions to and fro
and round the earth reverberating blow
the mute , world shaking music of the mind
that thou might'st make as naught all space and time
AABB
oh , modest maiden morn ! why dost thou blush
who thus betimes art walking in the sky
‘ tis i , whose cheek bears pleasure 's sleepless flush
who shame to meet thy gray , cloud lidded eye
ABAB
shadowy , yet clear : from the bright eastern door
where the sun 's shafts lie bound with thongs of fire
along the heaven 's amber paved floor
the glad hours move , hymning their early choir
ABAB
o , fair and fragrant morn ! upon my brow
press thy fresh lips , shake from thy dropping hair
cold showers of balmy dew on me , and ere
day 's chariot wheels upon th ’ horizon glow
ABBA
the husband quite astonished now appeared
at once a hundred diff'rent ills he feared
but questioning his wife howe'er , he found
that many other dames who lived around
AABB
like her ; in paying tithes , the monks obeyed
which consolation to his breast conveyed
poor innocent ! she nothing wished to hide
said she , not one but tithe they make provide
AABB
good friar aubrey takes your sister 's dues
to father fabry mrs. b 's accrues
the mayoress friar william likes to greet
a monk more handsome scarcely you will meet
AABB
full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
ABAB
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
ABAB
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendour on my brow
but out alack , he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath masked him from me now
ABAB
more she had spoke , but yawn 'd — all nature nods
what mortal can resist the yawn of gods
churches and chapels instantly it reach 'd
( st james 's first , for leaden gilbert
AABB
then catch 'd the schools ; the hall scarce kept awake
the convocation gaped , but could not speak
lost was the nation 's sense , nor could be found
while the long solemn unison went round
AABB
wide , and more wide , it spread o'er all the realm
even palinurus nodded at the helm
the vapour mild o'er each committee crept
unfinish 'd treaties in each office slept
AABB
not love of you is most that i can bring
since what i am to love you is the test
and should i love you more than any thing
you would but be of idle love possessed
ABAB
a mere love wandering in appetite
counting your glories and yet bringing none
finding in you occasions of delight
a thief of payment for no service done
ABAB
but when of labouring life i make a song
and bring it you , as that were my reward
to let what most is me to you belong
then do i come of high possessions lord
ABAB
“ thus having pass 'd the night in fruitless pain
i to my longing friends return again
amaz 'd th ’ augmented number to behold
of men and matrons mix 'd , of young and old
AABB
a wretched exil 'd crew together brought
with arms appointed , and with treasure fraught
resolv 'd , and willing , under my command
to run all hazards both of sea and land
AABB
the morn began , from ida , to display
her rosy cheeks ; and phosphor led the day
before the gates the grecians took their post
and all pretense of late relief was lost
AABB
and should the twilight darken into night
and sorrow grow to anguish , be thou strong
thou art in god , and nothing can go wrong
which a fresh life pulse cannot set aright
ABBA
that thou dost know the darkness , proves the light
weep if thou wilt , but weep not all too long
or weep and work , for work will lead to song
but search thy heart , if , hid from all thy sight
ABBA
there lies no cause for beauty 's slow decay
if for completeness and diviner youth
and not for very love , thou seek'st the truth
if thou hast learned to give thyself away
ABBA
where mexic hills the breezy gulph defend
spontaneous groves with richer burdens bend
anana 's stalk its shaggy honors yields
acassia 's flowers perfume a thousand fields
AABB
their cluster 'd dates the mast like palms unfold
the spreading orange waves a load of gold
connubial vines o'ertop the larch they climb
the long lived olive mocks the moth of time
AABB
pomona 's pride , that old grenada claims
here smiles and reddens in diviner flames
pimento , citron scent the sky serene
white woolly clusters fringe the cotton 's green
AABB
the spark concealed himself ; each charm admired
now this , now that , now t'other feature fired
a hundred beauties caught his eager sight
and while his bosom felt supreme delight
AABB
he turned his thoughts advantages to take
and of the maiden 's error something make
assumed the character , and dress ; and air
that should a wat'ry deity declare
AABB
within the gliding flood his vestments dipt
a crown of rushes on his head he slipt
aquatick herbs and plants around he twined
then mercury intreated to be kind
AABB
with all our hearts we praise you whom ye hate
high souls that hate us ; for our hopes are higher
and higher than yours the goal of our desire
though high your ends be as your hearts are great
ABBA
your world of gods and kings , of shrine and state
was of the night when hope and fear stood nigher
wherein men walked by light of stars and fire
till man by day stood equal with his fate
ABBA
honour not hate we give you , love not fear
last prophets of past kind , who fill the dome
of great dead gods with wrath and wail , nor hear
time 's word and man 's : “ go honoured hence , go home
ABAB
as due by many titles , i resign
myself to thee , o god ! first i was made
by thee , and for thee ; and when i was decayed
thy blood bought that , the which before was thine
ABBA
i am thy son , made with thyself to shine
thy servant , whose pains thou hast still repaid
thy sheep , thine image ; and , till i betrayed
myself , a temple of thy spirit divine
ABBA
why doth the devil then usurp on me
why doth he steal , nay , ravish , that 's thy right
except thou rise , and for thine own work fight
oh ! i shall soon despair , when i shall see
ABBA
master of human destinies am i
fame , love and fortune on my footsteps wait
cities and fields i walk : i penetrate
deserts and fields remote , and , passing by
ABBA
hovel and mart and palace , soon or late
i knock unbidden once at every gate
if sleeping , wake : if feasting , rise before
i turn away . it is the hour of fate
AABB
and they who follow me reach every state
mortals desire , and conquer every foe
save death ; but those who doubt or hesitate
condemned to failure , penury and woe
ABAB
x . cease , then , nor order imperfection name
our proper bliss depends on what we blame
know thy own point : this kind , this due degree
of blindness , weakness , heaven bestows on thee
AABB
submit . in this , or any other sphere
secure to be as blest as thou canst bear
safe in the hand of one disposing power
or in the natal , or the mortal hour
AABB
all nature is but art , unknown to thee
all chance , direction , which thou canst not see
all discord , harmony not understood
all partial evil , universal good
AABB
man , that wast godlike being a child , and now
no less than kinglike , art no more in sooth
for all thy grace and lordliness of youth
the crown that bids men 's branded foreheads bow
ABBA
much more has branded and bowed down thy brow
and gnawn upon it as with fire or tooth
of steel or snake so sorely , that the truth
seems here to bear false witness . is it thou
ABBA
child ? and is all the summer of all thy spring
this ? are the smiles that drew men 's kisses down
all faded and transfigured to the frown
that grieves thy face ? art thou this weary thing
ABBA
life ! austere arbiter of each man 's fate
by whom he learns that nature 's steadfast laws
are as decrees immutable ; o pause
your even forward march ! not yet too late
ABBA
teach me the needed lesson , when to wait
inactive as a ship when no wind draws
to stretch the loosened cordage . one implores
thy clemency , whose wilfulness innate
ABBA
has gone uncurbed and roughshod while the years
have lengthened into decades ; now distressed
he knows no rule by which to move or stay
and teased with restlessness and desperate fears
ABBA
the weary mariner so fast not flies
a howling tempest , harbour to attain
nor shepherd hastes , when frays of wolves arise
so fast to fold , to save his bleating train
ABAB
as i , wing 'd with contempt and just disdain
now fly the world , and what it most doth prize
and sanctuary seek , free to remain
from wounds of abject times , and envy 's eyes
ABAB
to me this world did once seem sweet and fair
while senses ’ light mind 's prospective kept blind
now , like imagined landscape in the air
and weeping rainbows , her best joys i find
ABAB
blame not my heart for flying up so high
sith thou art cause that it this flight begun
for earthly vapours drawn up by the sun
comets become , and night suns in the sky
ABBA
mine humble heart , so with thy heavenly eye
drawn up aloft , all low desires doth shun
raise thou me up , as thou my heart hast done
so during night in heaven remain may i
ABBA
i say again , blame not my high desire
sith of us both the cause thereof depends
in thee doth shine , in me doth burn a fire
fire draws up other , and itself ascends
ABAB
innocent paper ! whom too cruell hand
did make the matter to avenge her yre
and ere she could thy cause well understand
did sacrifize unto the greedy fyre
ABAB
whom she , all carelesse of his grief , constrayned
to utter forth the anguish of his hart
and would not heare , when he to her complayned
the piteous passion of his dying smart
ABAB
when the first larvae on the elm are seen
the crawling wretches , like its leaves , are green
ere chill october shakes the latest down
they , like the foliage , change their tint to brown
AABB
on the blue flower a bluer flower you spy
you stretch to pluck it — ‘ tis a butterfly
the flattened tree toads so resemble bark
they 're hard to find as ethiops in the dark
AABB
the woodcock , stiffening to fictitious mud
cheats the young sportsman thirsting for his blood
so by long living on a single lie
nay , on one truth , will creatures get its dye
AABB
most strength the moving principle requires
active its task , it prompts , impels , inspires
sedate and quiet the comparing lies
form 'd but to check , deliberate , and advise
AABB
self love , still stronger , as its objects nigh
reason 's at distance , and in prospect lie
that sees immediate good by present sense
reason , the future and the consequence
AABB
thicker than arguments , temptations throng
at best more watchful this , but that more strong
the action of the stronger to suspend
reason still use , to reason still attend
AABB
as are the sands , fair licia , on the shore
or colored flowers , garlands of the spring
or as the frosts not seen , not felt before
or as the fruits that autumn forth doth bring
ABAB
as twinkling stars , the tinsel of the night
or as the fish that gallop in the seas
as airs each part that still escapes our sight
so are my sighs , controllers of my ease
ABAB
yet these are such as needs must have an end
for things finite none else hath nature done
only the sighs , which from my heart i send
will never cease , but where they first begun
ABAB
a wrinkled , crabb é d man they picture thee
old winter , with a rugged beard as gray
as the long moss upon the apple tree
blue lipt , an ice drop at thy sharp blue nose
ABAB
oft do i marvel whether delia 's eyes
are eyes , or else two radiant stars that shine
for how could nature ever thus devise
of earth , on earth , a substance so divine
ABAB
yet whether fixed or wandering stars are they
whose influence rules the orb of my poor heart
fixed , sure , they are , but wandering make me stray
in endless errors whence i cannot part
ABAB
a light wind , from the open casement , fanned
my brow and helen 's , as we , hand in hand
sat looking out upon the twilight scene
in dreamy silence . helen 's dark blue eyes
AABB
like two lost stars that wandered from the skies
some night adown the meteor 's shining track
and always had been grieving to go back
now gazed up , wistfully , at heaven 's dome
ABBA
and seemed to recognise and long for home
her sweet voice broke the silence : “ wish , maurine
before you speak ! you know the moon is new
and anything you wish for will come true
AABB
i might have died before my life begun
whenas my father for his country 's good
the persian 's favor and the sophy won
and yet with danger of his dearest blood
ABAB
thy father , sweet , whom danger did beset
escap è d all , and for no other end
but only this , that you he might beget
whom heavens decreed into the world to send
ABAB
then father , thank thy daughter for thy life
and neptune praise that yielded so to thee
to calm the tempest when the storms were rife
and that thy daughter should a venus be
ABAB
“ the prophet bless 'd the parting crew , and last
with words like these , his ancient friend embrac 'd
‘ old happy man , the care of gods above
whom heav'nly venus honor 'd with her love
AABB
and twice preserv 'd thy life , when troy was lost
behold from far the wish 'd ausonian coast
there land ; but take a larger compass round
for that before is all forbidden ground
AABB
the shore that phoebus has design 'd for you
at farther distance lies , conceal 'd from view
go happy hence , and seek your new abodes
blest in a son , and favor 'd by the gods
AABB
‘ twas a sweet time for nesace — for there
her world lay lolling on the golden air
near four bright suns — a temporary rest
an oasis in desert of the blest
AABB
away away — ‘ mid seas of rays that roll
empyrean splendor o'er th ’ unchained soul
the soul that scarce ( the billows are so dense
can struggle to its destin 'd eminence
AABB
to distant spheres , from time to time , she rode
and late to ours , the favour 'd one of god
but , now , the ruler of an anchor 'd realm
she throws aside the sceptre — leaves the helm
AABB
they swept up much , they shovelled up more
there never was such a snow man before
they built him bravely with might and main
there never will be such a snow man again
AABB
his legs were big , his body was bigger
they made him a most imposing figure
his eyes were large and as black as coal
for a cinder was placed in each round hole
AABB
and the sight of his teeth would have made yours ache
being simply the teeth of an ancient rake
they smoothed his forehead , they patted his back
there was n't a single unsightly crack
AABB
i said i splendidly loved you ; it 's not true
such long swift tides stir not a land locked sea
on gods or fools the high risk falls — on you
the clean clear bitter sweet that 's not for me
ABAB
love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist
love is flung lucifer like from heaven to hell
but — there are wanderers in the middle mist
who cry for shadows , clutch , and cannot tell
ABAB
whether they love at all , or , loving , whom
an old song 's lady , a fool in fancy dress
or phantoms , or their own face on the gloom
for love of love , or from heart 's loneliness
ABAB
fired with the martial deeds that bathed in gore
his brave companions on his native shore
trumbull with daring hand their fame recals
he shades with night quebec 's beleagured walls
AABB
thro flashing flames , that midnight war supplies
the assailants yield , their great montgomery dies
on bunker height , thro floods of hostile fire
his putnam toils till all the troops retire
AABB
his warren , pierced with balls , at last lies low
and leaves a victory to the wasted foe
britannia too his glowing tint shall claim
to pour new splendor on her calpean fame
AABB
the birds sung their sorrows the whole summer long
and the robin first mixed up his ills with his song
he sung of his griefs — how in love he 'd been crossed
and gave up his heart as eternally lost
AABB
‘ t was burnt to a coal , as sly cupid let fall
a spark that scorched through both the feathers and all
to cure it time tried , but ne'er found out the way
so the mark on his bosom he wears to this day
AABB
and when birds are all silent , and not a leaf seen
on the trees , but the ivy and holly so green
in frost and in snow little robin will sing
to put off the sorrow that ruffles his wing
AABB
i 've called you father , praised your royal grace
behind your back as well as to your face
you 've owned i have a conscience : try me now
if i can quit your gifts with cheerful brow
AABB
that was a prudent answer which , we 're told
the son of wise ulysses made of old
“ our ithaca is scarce the place for steeds
it has no level plains , no grassy meads
AABB
atrides , if you 'll let me , i 'll decline
a gift that better meets your wants than mine
small things become small folks : imperial rome
is all too large , too bustling for a home
AABB
green tinted steppes with distant bluish rim
the trooping clouds in heaven 's spaces dim
unto the heart how the familiar cries
the village mean that in the valley lies
AABB
the wealthy cities ’ towering majesty
the empty snow fields ’ endless boundary
the changeful moods that all unbridled throng
spirit of russia and of russian song
AABB
adieu ! dear girl ! if we are doom 'd to part
take with thee , take , the blessing of this heart
due to thy gentle mind , and cultur 'd sense
perhaps ‘ twill please , but , sure , can n't give offence
AABB
tho ’ , when we met , the solar ray was gone
and on our steps the moon beam only shone
yet well i mark 'd thy form and native grace
and all the sweet expression of thy face
AABB
and pleas 'd i listen 'd as thy accents fell
accents that spoke a feeling mind so well
lo , when the birds repose at ev'ning hour
the sweetest of them carols from her bow'r
AABB
whilst his redeemer on his canvass dies
stabb ’ d at his feet his brother weltering lies
the daring artist , cruelly serene
views the pale cheek and the distorted mien
AABB
he drains off life by drops , and , deaf to cries
examines every spirit as it flies
he studies torment , dives in mortal woe
to rouse up every pang repeats his blow
AABB
each rising agony , each dreadful grace
yet warm transplanting to his saviour ’ s face
oh glorious theft ! oh nobly wicked draught
with its full charge of death each feature fraught
AABB
and each wild beauty smote it , though the sound
rung to the night winds oft and desert air
beneath thine eyes the lily paled more fair
and each still shadow slanting on the ground
ABBA
th ’ adventure charm 'd him , and next morning rose
the sabbath , with its silence and repose
the bells ceas 'd chiming , and the broad blue sky
smil 'd on his peace , and met his tranquil eye
AABB
inverted , from the foot bridge on his way
to that still house where all his fathers lay
there in his seat , each neighbour 's face he knew
the stranger girl was just before his pew
AABB
he saw her kneel , with meek , but cheerful air
and whisper the response to every prayer
and , when the humble roof with praises rung
he caught the hallelujah from her tongue
AABB
far out of bounds he 's figured — in a race
of west end traffic pitching to his loss
but if you 'd see him in his proper place
making the browns for bub and grub and doss
ABAB
go east among the merchants and their men
and where the press is noisiest , and the tides
of trade run highest and widest , there and then
you shall behold him , edging with equal strides
ABAB
along the kerb ; hawking in either hand
some artful nothing made of twine and tin
cardboard and foil and bits of rubber band
some penn'orth of wit in fact that , with a grin
ABAB
the other maidens raised their eyes to him
who stumbled in before them when the fight
had left him victor , with a victor 's right
i think his eyes with quick hot tears grew dim
ABBA
he scarcely saw her swaying white and slim
and trembling slightly , dreaming of his might
nor knew he touched her hand , as strangely light
as a wan wraith 's beside a river 's rim
ABBA
the other maidens raised their eyes to see
and only she has hid her face away
and yet i ween she loved him more than they
and very fairly fashioned was her face
ABBA
if glorious visions , born for all mankind
the bright auroras of our twilight mind
if fancies , varying as the shapes that lie
stained on the windows of the sunset sky
AABB
if hopes , that beckon with delusive gleams
till the eye dances in the void of dreams
if passions , following with the winds that urge
earth 's wildest wanderer to her farthest verge
AABB
if these on all some transient hours bestow
of rapture tingling with its hectic glow
then all are poets ; and if earth had rolled
her myriad centuries , and her doom were told
AABB
in the chill silence of the winter eve
thro ’ lichfield 's darken 'd streets i bend my way
by that sad mansion , where nerina 's clay
awaits the morning knell ;— and awed perceive
ABBA
in the late bridal chamber , the clear ray
of numerous lights ; while o'er the ceiling stray
shadows of those who frequent pass beneath
round the pale dead .— what sounds my senses grieve
AABB
he eats ( a moment 's stoppage to his song
the stolen turnip as he goes along
and hops along and heeds with careless eye
the passing crowded stage coach reeling bye
AABB
he talks to none but wends his silent way
and finds a hovel at the close of day
or under any hedge his house is made
he has no calling and he owns no trade
AABB
an old smoaked blanket arches oer his head
a whisp of straw or stubble makes his bed
he knows a lawless law that claims no kin
but meet and plunder on and feel no sin
AABB
pale are my looks , forsaken of my life
cinders my bones , consum è d with thy flame
floods are my tears , to end this burning strife
and yet i sigh for to increase the same
ABAB
i mourn alone because alone i burn
who doubts of this , then let him learn to love
her looks cold ice into a flame can turn
as i distress è d in myself do prove
ABAB
respect , fair licia , what my torments are
count but the tithe both of my sighs and tears
see how my love doth still increase my care
and care 's increase my life to nothing wears
ABAB
the lad disguised was terrified to death
each plan was dissipated with a breath
the more he thought of means from thence to get
the greater were the obstacles he met
AABB
at length necessity ( the parent found
of stratagems and wiles , so much renowned
induced the youth . . . ( i scarcely can proceed
to tie . . . expression here i clearly need
AABB
what word will decently express the thought
what book has got it ?— where should it be sought
you 've heard , in days of yore that human kind
with windows in their bosoms were designed
AABB
a lamprey now appears , a sprawling fish
with shrimps about it swimming in the dish
whereon our host remarks : “ this fish was caught
while pregnant : after spawning it is naught
AABB
we make our sauce with oil , of the best strain
venafrum yields , and caviare from spain
pour in italian wine , five years in tun
while yet ‘ tis boiling ; when the boiling 's done
AABB
chian suits best of all ; white pepper add
and vinegar , from lesbian wine turned bad
rockets and elecampanes with this mess
to boil , is my invention , i profess
AABB
i never saw that you did painting need
and therefore to your fair no painting set
i found ( or thought i found ) you did exceed
that barren tender of a poet 's debt
ABAB
and therefore have i slept in your report
that you your self being extant well might show
how far a modern quill doth come too short
speaking of worth , what worth in you doth grow
ABAB
this silence for my sin you did impute
which shall be most my glory being dumb
for i impair not beauty being mute
when others would give life , and bring a tomb
ABAB
friend to my life ! ( which did not you prolong
the world had wanted many an idle song
what drop or nostrum can this plague remove
or which must end me , a fool 's wrath or love
AABB
a dire dilemma ! either way i 'm sped
if foes , they write , if friends , they read me dead
seized and tied down to judge , how wretched i
who can n't be silent , and who will not lie
AABB
to laugh , were want of goodness and of grace
and to be grave , exceeds all power of face
i sit with sad civility , i read
with honest anguish , and an aching head
AABB
ioy of my life ! full oft for loving you
i blesse my lot , that was so lucky placed
but then the more your owne mishap i rew
that are so much by so meane love embased
ABAB
but since ye deignd so goodly to relent
to me your thrall , in whom is little worth
that little that i am shall all be spent
in setting your immortal prayses forth
ABAB
lo here the impost of a faith entire
that love doth pay , and her disdain extorts
behold the message of a chaste desire
that tells the world how much my grief imports
ABAB
these tributary passions , beauty 's due
i send those eyes , the cabinets of love
that cruelty herself might grieve to view
th'affliction her unkind disdain doth move
ABAB
and how i live , cast down from off all mirth
pensive , alone , only but with despair
my joys abortive perish in their birth
my griefs long lived and care succeeding care
ABAB
it may be for the world of weeds and tares
and dearth in nature of sweet beauty 's rose
that oft as fortune from ten thousand shows
one from the train of love 's true courtiers
ABBA
straightway on him who gazes , unawares
deep wonder seizes and swift trembling grows
reft by that sight of purpose and repose
hardly its weight his fainting breast upbears
ABBA
then on the soul from some ancestral place
floods back remembrance of its heavenly birth
when , in the light of that serener sphere
it saw ideal beauty face to face
ABBA
backwell , the generous temper of whose mind
was always to be bountiful inclin 'd
whether by his ill fate or fancy led
first took me up , and furnish 'd me with bread
AABB
large was his soul , his temper ever free
the best of masters and of men to me
and i who was before decreed by fate
to be made infamous as well as great
AABB
the clock chimed three , and we yet strayed at will
about the yard in morning dishabille
when aunt ruth came , with apron o'er her head
holding a letter in her hand , and said
AABB
“ here is a note , from vivian i opine
at least his servant brought it . and now , girls
you may think this is no concern of mine
but in my day young ladies did not go
ABAB
till almost bed time roaming to and fro
in morning wrappers , and with tangled curls
the very pictures of forlorn distress
‘ tis three o'clock , and time for you to dress
AABB
now each partakes the feast , the wine prepares
portions the food , and each his portion shares
the bard a herald guides ; the gazing throng
pay low obeisance as he moves along
AABB
beneath a sculptur 'd arch he sits enthroned
the peers encircling form an awful round
then , from the chine , ulysses carves with art
delicious food , an honorary part
AABB
“ this , let the master of the lyre receive
a pledge of love ! ‘ tis all a wretch can give
lives there a man beneath the spacious skies
who sacred honours to the bard denies
AABB
to him the monarch : “ just is thy decree
thy words give joy , and wisdom breathes in thee
each due atonement gladly i prepare
and heaven regard me as i justly swear
AABB
here then awhile let greece assembled stay
nor great achilles grudge this short delay
till from the fleet our presents be convey ’ d
and jove attesting , the firm compact made
AABB
a train of noble youths the charge shall bear
these to select , ulysses , be thy care
in order rank ’ d let all our gifts appear
and the fair train of captives close the rear
AABB
lay me where soft cyrene rambles down
in grove and garden to the sapphire sea
twine yellow roses for the drinker 's crown
let music reach and fair heads circle me
ABAB
what i have instanced only in the best
is , in proportion , true of all the rest
take pains the genuine meaning to explore
there sweat , there strain : tug the laborious oar
AABB
search every comment that your care can find
some here , some there , may hit the poet 's mind
yet be not blindly guided by the throng
the multitude is always in the wrong
AABB
when things appear unnatural or hard
consult your author , with himself compared
who knows what blessing phoebus may bestow
and future ages to your labour owe
AABB
my love was masked , and arm è d with a fan
to see the sun so careless of his light
which stood and gazed , and gazing wax è d wan
to see a star himself that was more bright
ABAB
some did surmize she hid her from the sun
of whom in pride she scorned for to be kissed
or feared the harm by him to others done
but these the reason of this wonder missed
ABAB
nor durst the sun , if that her face were bare
in greatest pride , presume to take a kiss
but she more kind did show she had more care
than with her eyes eclipse him of his bliss
ABAB
how oft when thou , my music , music play'st
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds
ABAB
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
at the wood 's boldness by thee blushing stand
ABAB
to be so tickled they would change their state
and situation with those dancing chips
o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
making dead wood more blest than living lips
ABAB
oft let me range the gloomy aisles alone
sad luxury ! to vulgar minds unknown
along the walls where speaking marbles show
what worthies form the hallowed mould belew
AABB
proud names , who once the reins of empire held
in arms who triumphed , or in arts excelled
chiefs , graced with scars , and prodigal of blood
stern patriots , who for sacred freedom stood
AABB
just men , by whom impartial laws were given
and saints , who taught and led the way to heaven
ne'er to these chambers , where the mighty rest
since their foundation came a nobler guest
AABB
as by the west wind driv'n , the ocean waves
dash forward on the far resounding shore
wave upon wave ; first curls the ruffled sea
with whit'ning crests ; anon with thund'ring roar
ABAB
where dim the ethereal eye , no art , though clear
as golden star in morning 's amber springs
can pierce the fogs of low imaginings
painting and sculpture are a mockery mere
ABBA
where dull to deafness is the hearing ear
vain is the poet . nought but earthly things
have credence . when the soaring skylark sings
how shall the stony statue strain to hear
ABBA
open the deaf ear , wake the sleeping eye
and lo , musicians , painters , poets — all
trooping instinctive , come without a call
as winds that where they list blow evermore
ABBA
in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn
in vowing new hate after new love bearing
ABAB
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
oaths of thy love , thy truth , thy constancy
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
or made them swear against the thing they see
ABAB
the voices of the city and the sea
the voices of the mountains and the pines
repeat thy song , till the familiar lines
are footpaths for the thought of italy
ABBA
through suffering and sorrow thou hast passed
to show us what a woman true may be
they have not taken sympathy from thee
nor made thee any other than thou wast
ABBA
save as some tree , which , in a sudden blast
sheddeth those blossoms , that are weakly grown
upon the air , but keepeth every one
whose strength gives warrant of good fruit at last
ABBA
if in this storm of joy and pompous throng
this nymph ( great king ) doth come to thee so near
that thy harmonious ears her accents hear
give pardon to her hoarse and lowly song
ABBA
fain would she trophies to thy virtues rear
but for this stately task she is not strong
and her defects her high attempts do wrong
yet as she could she makes thy worth appear
ABBA
so in a map is shown this flowery place
so wrought in arras by a virgin 's hand
with heaven and blazing stars doth atlas stand
so drawn by charcoal is narcissus ’ face
ABBA
again i follow it , throughout the day
with anxious eyes i see it trip and fall
and hurt itself in many a foolish way
childlike , unheeding warning word or call
ABAB
i see it grasp , and grasping , break the toys
it cried to own , then toss them on the floor
and , breathless , hurry after fancied joys
that cease to please , when added to its store
ABAB
i see the lacerations on its hands
made by forbidden tools ; but when it weeps
i also weep , as one who understands
and having been a child , the memory keeps
ABAB
sweet heart , forgive me for thine own sweet sake
whose kind blithe soul such seas of sorrow swam
and for my love 's sake , powerless as i am
for love to praise thee , or like thee to make
ABBA
music of mirth where hearts less pure would break
less pure than thine , our life unspotted lamb
things hatefullest thou hadst not heart to damn
nor wouldst have set thine heel on this dead snake
ABBA
let worms consume its memory with its tongue
the fang that stabbed fair truth , the lip that stung
men 's memories uncorroded with its breath
forgive me , that with bitter words like his
AABB
o opulent life of ours , though dispossessed
of treasure after treasure ! youth most fair
went first , but left its priceless coil of hair
moaned over sleepless nights , kissed and caressed
ABBA
through drip and blur of tears the tenderest
and next went love — the ripe rose glowing there
her very sister !... it is here ; but where
is she , of all the world the first and best
ABBA
on him converge the sun beams of her eyes
and he unblamed may gaze upon my fair
and oft my fair his favored form surveys
o happy picture ! still on her to gaze
AABB
i envy him ! and jealous fear alarms
lest the strong glance of those divinest charms
warm him to life , as in the ancient days
when marble melted in pygmalion 's arms
AABB
it is not , y ’ are deceav 'd , it is not blisse
what you conceave a happy living is
to have your hands with rubies bright to glow
then on your tortoise bed your body throw
AABB
v. and love had not been prisoned in cold stone
nor beauty smeared on the dead canvas so
had not their worshipper been forced to go
questful and restless through the world alone
ABBA
searching but finding not , till on him shone
back from his own deep heart a chilly glow
as of a frost nipped sunbeam , or of snow
under a storm dodged crescent which hath grown
ABBA
wasted to mockery ; and beneath such gleam
his wan conceits have found an utterance
which , had they found a true and sunny beam
had ripened into real touch and glance
ABAB
so take these kindly , even though there be
some notes that unto other lyres belong
stray echoes from the elder sons of song
and think how from its neighbouring native sea
ABBA
the pensive shell doth borrow melody
i would not do the lordly masters wrong
by filching fair words from the shining throng
whose music haunts me as the wind a tree
ABBA
surely the boy his sister 's secret guessed
since only kindness dwells within his breast
toward his ancestral foe . by friendly signs
each comely youth the other 's thought divines
AABB
then suddenly exclaims the dauntless sioux
“ listen , my friend ! i must return with you
to ask and win this maiden for my wife
“ return with us ! not if you prize your life
AABB
the startled blackfoot answers . “ you must know
that all our tribe regard you as a foe
my sister 's suitors are as many now
as yonder leaves that twinkle on the bough
AABB
was it the worke of nature or of art
which tempred so the feature of her face
that pride and meeknesse , mist by equall part
doe both appeare t'adorne her beauties grace
ABAB
for with mild pleasance , which doth pride displace
she to her love doth lookers eyes allure
and with stern countenance back again doth chace
their looser lookes that stir up lustes impure
ABAB
with such strange termes * her eyes she doth inure
that with one looke she doth my life dismay
and with another doth it streight recure
her smile me drawes ; her frowne me drives away
ABAB
whether he lurked in the oldtown fen
or the gray earth flax of the devil 's den
or swam in the wooded artichoke
or coiled by the northman 's written rock
AABB
nothing on record is left to show
only the fact that he lived , we know
and left the cast of a double head
in the scaly mask which he yearly shed
AABB
for he carried a head where his tail should be
and the two , of course , could never agree
but wriggled about with main and might
now to the left and now to the right
AABB
great truths are portions of the soul of man
great souls are portions of eternity
each drop of blood that e'er through true heart ran
with lofty message , ran for thee and me
ABAB
for god 's law , since the starry song began
hath been , and still forevermore must be
that every deed which shall outlast time 's span
must spur the soul to be erect and free
ABAB
slave is no word of deathless lineage sprung
too many noble souls have thought and died
too many mighty poets lived and sung
and our good saxon , from lips purified
ABAB
“ take this , and pour to jove ; that safe from harms
his grace restore thee to our roof and arms
since victor of thy fears , and slighting mine
heaven , or thy soul , inspires this bold design
AABB
let the strong sovereign of the plumy race
tower on the right of yon ethereal space
that sign beheld , and strengthen ’ d from above
boldly pursue the journey mark ’ d by jove
AABB
come walk with me along this willowed lane
where , like lost coinage from some miser 's store
the golden dandelions more and more
glow , as the warm sun kisses them again
ABBA
for this is may ! who with a daisy chain
leads on the laughing hours ; for now is o'er
long winter 's trance . no longer rise and roar
his forest wrenching blasts . the hopeful swain
ABBA
along the furrow , sings behind his team
loud pipes the redbreast — troubadour of spring
and vocal all the morning copses ring
more blue the skies in lucent lakelets gleam
ABBA
less bronze , more silver , mingles in the mould
of him whom next my roving eyes behold
his , more the scholar 's than the statesman 's face
proclaims him born of academic race
AABB
weary his look , as if an aching brain
left on his brow the frozen prints of pain
his voice far reaching , grave , sonorous , owns
a shade of sadness in its plaintive tones
AABB
yet when its breath some loftier thought inspires
glows with a heat that every bosom fires
such everett seems ; no chance sown wild flower knows
the full blown charms of culture 's double rose
AABB
“ ye sons of atreus , and ye greeks , give ear
the words of troy , and troy ’ s great monarch , hear
pleased may ye hear ( so heaven succeed my prayers
what paris , author of the war , declares
AABB
the spoils and treasures he to ilion bore
( oh had he perish ’ d ere they touch ’ d our shore
he proffers injured greece : with large increase
of added trojan wealth to buy the peace
AABB
but to restore the beauteous bride again
this greece demands , and troy requests in vain
next , o ye chiefs ! we ask a truce to burn
our slaughter ’ d heroes , and their bones inurn
AABB
cromwell , our chief of men , who through a cloud
not of war only , but detractions rude
guided by faith and matchless fortitude
to peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed
ABBA
and on the neck of crown è d fortune proud
hast reared god 's trophies , and his work pursued
while darwen stream , with blood of scots imbrued
and dunbar field , resounds thy praises loud
ABBA
and worcester 's laureate wreath : yet much remains
to conquer still ; peace hath her victories
no less renowned than war : new foes arise
threatening to bind our souls with secular chains
ABBA
beyond the north wind lay the land of old
where men dwelt blithe and blameless , clothed and fed
with joy 's bright raiment and with love 's sweet bread
the whitest flock of earth 's maternal fold
ABBA
none there might wear about his brows enrolled
a light of lovelier fame than rings your head
whose lovesome love of children and the dead
all men give thanks for : i far off behold
ABBA
a dear dead hand that links us , and a light
the blithest and benignest of the night
the night of death 's sweet sleep , wherein may be
a star to show your spirit in present sight
AABB
say what you will , there is not in the world
a nobler sight than from this upper down
no rugged landscape here , no beauty hurled
from its creator 's hand as with a frown
ABAB
but a green plain on which green hills look down
trim as a garden plot . no other hue
can hence be seen , save here and there the brown
of a square fallow , and the horizon 's blue
ABAB
o than the fairest day , thrice fairer night
night to blest days in which a sun doth rise
of which that golden age which clears the skies
is but a sparkling ray , a shadow light
ABBA
and blessed ye , in silly pastors ’ sight
mild creatures , in whose warm crib now lies
that heaven sent youngling , holy maid born wight
midst , end , beginning of our prophecies
ABAB
blest cottage that hath flowers in winter spread
though withered — blessed grass that hath the grace
to deck and be a carpet to that place
thus sang , unto the sounds , of oaten reed
ABBA
once more upon the ocean 's heaving breast
he lays his head , not like the lover bold
who in the brave , chivalric days of old
wooed from her lips the secret of the west
ABBA
but like a tired man going to his rest
no hopes to thrill , no yearnings to inspire
no tasks to burden , and no toil to tire
no morn to waken to a day of quest
ABBA
again upon the trackless deep ,— again
about him as of yore the wild winds play
behind him lies the world he gave to men
before a grave in old castile for aye
ABAB
thrise happie she that is so well assured
unto her selfe , and setled so in hart
that neither will for better be allured
ne feard with worse to any chaunce to start
ABAB
but , like a steddy ship , doth strongly part
the raging waves , and kcepes her course aright
ne ought for tempest doth from it depart
ne ought for fayrer weathers false delight
ABAB
such selfe assurance need not feare the spight
of grudging foes , ne favour seek of friends
but in the stay of her owne stedfast might
neither to one her selfe nor other bends
ABAB
and , as a savage boar , on mountains bred
with forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed
when once he sees himself in toils inclos 'd
by huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd
AABB
he whets his tusks , and turns , and dares the war
th ’ invaders dart their jav'lins from afar
all keep aloof , and safely shout around
but none presumes to give a nearer wound
AABB
he frets and froths , erects his bristled hide
and shakes a grove of lances from his side
not otherwise the troops , with hate inspir 'd
and just revenge against the tyrant fir 'd
AABB
these moralists could act and comprehend
they knew how genuine glory was put on
taught us how rightfully a nation shone
in splendor : what strength was , that would not bend
ABBA
but in magnanimous meekness . france , ‘ tis strange
hath brought forth no such souls as we had then
perpetual emptiness ! unceasing change
no single volume paramount , no code
ABAB
beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me
is't not enough to torture me alone
but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be
ABAB
me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken
and my next self thou harder hast engrossed
of him , my self , and thee i am forsaken
a torment thrice three fold thus to be crossed
ABAB
could time , his flight reversed , restore the hours
when , playing with thy vesture 's tissued flowers
the violet , the pink , the jessamine
i pricked them into paper with a pin
AABB
( and thou wast happier than myself the while
wouldst softly speak , and stroke my head and smile
could those few pleasant days again appear
might one wish bring them , would i wish them here
AABB
i would not trust my heart — the dear delight
seems so to be desired , perhaps i might
but no — what here we call our life is such
so little to be loved , and thou so much
AABB
i like the man who faces what he must
with step triumphant and a heart of cheer
who fights the daily battle without fear
sees his hopes fail , yet keeps unfaltering trust
ABBA
that god is god ; that somehow , true and just
his plans work out for mortals ; not a tear
is shed when fortune , which the world holds dear
falls from his grasp : better , with love , a crust
ABBA
than living in dishonor : envies not
nor loses faith in man ; but does his best
nor ever murmurs at his humbler lot
but , with a smile and words of hope , gives zest
ABAB
having this day my horse , my hand , my lance
guided so well , that i obtain 'd the prize
both by the judgment of the english eyes
and of some sent from that sweet enemy france
ABBA
horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance
townfolks my strength ; a daintier judge applies
his praise to sleight which from good use doth rise
some lucky wits impute it but to chance
ABBA
others , because of both sides i do take
my blood from them who did excel in this
think nature me a man of arms did make
how far they shot awry ! the true cause is
ABAB
the darkness in the loft is sweet and warm
with the stored hay ... darkness intensified
by one bright shaft that enters through the wide
tall doors from under fringes of a storm
ABBA
which makes the doomed sun brighter . on the hay
perched mountain high they sit , and silently
watch the motes dance and look at the dark sky
and mark how heartbreakingly far away
ABBA
and yet how close and clear the distance seems
while all at hand is cloud — brightness of dreams
unrealisable , yet seen so clear
so only just beyond the dark . they wait
AABB
there hung a calm and solemn sunshine round
those mighty monuments , a hushing sound
in the still air that circled them which stole
like music of past times into my soul
AABB
i thought what myriads of the wise and brave
and beautiful had sunk into the grave
since earth first saw these wonders — and i said
“ are things eternal only for the dead
AABB
“ hath man no loftier hope than this which dooms
“ his only lasting trophies to be tombs
“ but ‘ tis not so — earth , heaven , all nature shows
“ he may become immortal — may unclose
AABB
what i have instanced only in the best
is , in proportion , true of all the rest
take pains the genuine meaning to explore
there sweat , there strain : tug the laborious oar
AABB
search every comment that your care can find
some here , some there , may hit the poet 's mind
yet be not blindly guided by the throng
the multitude is always in the wrong
AABB
when things appear unnatural or hard
consult your author , with himself compared
who knows what blessing phoebus may bestow
and future ages to your labour owe
AABB
he scampered to the bushes far away
the shepherd called the ploughman to the fray
the ploughman wished he had a gun to shoot
the old dog barked and followed the pursuit
AABB
the shepherd threw his hook and tottered past
the ploughman ran but none could go so fast
the woodman threw his faggot from the way
and ceased to chop and wondered at the fray
AABB
but when he saw the dog and heard the cry
he threw his hatchet — but the fox was bye
the shepherd broke his hook and lost the skin
he found a badger hole and bolted in
AABB
a tomb like silence reigns ; till female cries
burst forth at last , and these sad accents rise
was it for this , my son to distant lands
must trace the wilds , and tempt those lawless bands
AABB
and does the god obscure his golden throne
in mournful darkness for my slaughter 'd son
oh , had his beam ; ere that disastrous day
that call 'd the youth from these fond arms away
AABB
these five kings said one to another
‘ king unto king o'er the world is brother
seeing that now , for a sign and a wonder
a red eclipse and a tongue of thunder
AABB
a shape and a finger of desolation
is come against us a kingless nation
gibeon hath failed us : it were not good
that a man remember where gibeon stood
AABB
then gibeon sent to our captain , crying
‘ son of nun , let a shaft be flying
for unclean birds are gathering greedily
slack not thy hand , but come thou speedily
AABB
thou splendid girl that seemest the mother of all
dear ceres aphrodite , with every lure
that draws the bee to honey , with the call
of moth winged night to sinners , yet as pure
ABAB
as the white nun that counts the stars for beads
thou blest madonna of all broken needs
thou melusine , thou sister of sorrowing man
thou wave like laughter , thou dear sob in the throat
AABB
thou all enfolding mercy , and thou song
that gathers up each wild and wandering note
and takes and breaks and heals and breaks the heart
with the omnipotent tenderness of art
AABB
full on the sire the goddess of the skies
roll ’ d the large orbs of her majestic eyes
and thus return ’ d :—" austere saturnius , say
from whence this wrath , or who controls thy sway
AABB
thy boundless will , for me , remains in force
and all thy counsels take the destined course
but ’ tis for greece i fear : for late was seen
in close consult , the silver footed queen
AABB
jove to his thetis nothing could deny
nor was the signal vain that shook the sky
what fatal favour has the goddess won
to grace her fierce , inexorable son
AABB
betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famished for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
ABAB
with my love 's picture then my eye doth feast
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
another time mine eye is my heart 's guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
ABAB
so either by thy picture or my love
thy self away , art present still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them , and they with thee
ABAB
ours is the place at banquets , balls , and plays
sprightly our nights , polite are all our days
courts we frequent , where ‘ tis our pleasing care
to pay due visits , and address the fair
AABB
in fact , ‘ tis true , no nymph we could persuade
but still in fancy vanquish 'd every maid
of unknown duchesses lewd tales we tell
yet , would the world believe us , all were well
AABB
“ now , xanthus , æ thon , lampus , urge the chase
and thou , podargus ! prove thy generous race
be fleet , be fearless , this important day
and all your master ’ s well spent care repay
AABB
for this , high fed , in plenteous stalls ye stand
served with pure wheat , and by a princess ’ hand
for this my spouse , of great aetion ’ s line
so oft has steep ’ d the strengthening grain in wine
AABB
doe i not see that fayrest ym á ges
of hardest marble are of purpose made
for that they should endure through many ages
ne let theyr famous moniments to fade
ABAB
why then doe i , untrainde in lovers trade
her hardnes blame , which i should more commend
sith never ought was excellent assayde
which was not hard t'atchive and bring to end
ABAB
ne ought so hard , but he that would attend
mote soften it and to his will allure
so do i hope her stubborne hart to bend
and that it then more stedfast will endure
ABAB
“ ‘ tis strange what very strong advising
by word of mouth , or advertising
by chalking on wall , or placarding on vans
with fifty other different plans
AABB
the very high pressure , in fact , of pressing
it needs to persuade one to purchase a blessing
whether the soothing american syrup
a safety hat , or a safety stirrup
AABB
infallible pills for the human frame
or rowland 's o don'thypppheno ( an ominous name
a doudney 's suit which the shape so hits
that it beats all others into fits
AABB
the love which me so cruelly tormenteth
so pleasing is in my extreamest paine
that , all the more my sorrow it augmenteth
the more i love and doe embrace my bane
ABAB
ne do i wish ( for wishing were but vaine
to be acquit fro my continual smart
but ioy her thrall for ever to remayne
and yield for pledge my poor and captyved hart
ABAB
no rose that in a garden ever grew
in homer 's or in omar 's or in mine
though buried under centuries of fine
dead dust of roses , shut from sun and dew
ABBA
forever , and forever lost from view
but must again in fragrance rich as wine
the grey aisles of the air incarnadine
when the old summers surge into a new
ABBA
thus when i swear , “ i love with all my heart
‘ tis with the heart of lilith that i swear
‘ tis with the love of lesbia and lucrece
and thus as well my love must lose some part
ABBA
diodati — and i muse to tell the tale
this stubborn i , that love was wont despise
and make a laughter of his snares , unwise
am fallen — where honest feet will sometimes fail
ABBA
eyes softly splendent with a darkness dear
a speech that more than one tongue vassal hath
a voice that in the middle hemisphere
might make the tired moon wander from her path
ABAB
schonbergh , the ablest soldier of his age
with great nassau did in our cause engage
both join 'd for england 's rescue and defence
the greatest captain and the greatest prince
AABB
with what applause his stories did we tell
stories which europe 's volumes largely swell
we counted him an army in our aid
where he commanded , no man was afraid
AABB
his actions with a constant conquest shine
from villa vitiosa to the rhine
france , flanders , germany , his fame confess
and all the world was fond of him but us
AABB
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes
and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he
remembered in what a haughtier guise
he had flung an alms to leprosie
ABAB
when he girt his young life up in gilded mail
and set forth in search of the holy grail
the heart within him was ashes and dust
he parted in twain his single crust
AABB
he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink
and gave the leper to eat and drink
‘ t was a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread
‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl
AABB
this the event ! here springs the temple grand
whose mighty arches take in all the land
its twilight aisles stretch far away and reach
‘ mid lights and shadows which defy my speech
AABB
and near its portal which morn opened wide
grey janitor !— to let in all this tide
of prayerful men , most solemnly there stands
one recollection , which , for pious hands
AABB
is ready like the minster 's sculptured vase
with holy water for each reverent face
and mystic columns , which my fancy views
glow in a thousand soft , subduing hues
AABB
then she —" i haste to those remote abodes
where the great parents of the deathless gods
the reverend ocean and gray tethys , reign
on the last limits of the land and main
AABB
i visit these , to whose indulgent cares
i owe the nursing of my tender years
for strife , i hear , has made that union cease
which held so long that ancient pair in peace
AABB
the steeds , prepared my chariot to convey
o ’ er earth and seas , and through the aerial way
wait under ide : of thy superior power
to ask consent , i leave the olympian bower
AABB
the prizes next are order ’ d to the field
for the bold champions who the caestus wield
a stately mule , as yet by toils unbroke
of six years ’ age , unconscious of the yoke
AABB
is to the circus led , and firmly bound
next stands a goblet , massy , large , and round
achilles rising , thus : “ let greece excite
two heroes equal to this hardy fight
AABB
who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke
and rush beneath the long descending stroke
on whom apollo shall the palm bestow
and whom the greeks supreme by conquest know
AABB
rise from your gory ashes stern and pale
ye martyred thousands ! and with dreadful ire
a voice of doom , a front of gloomy fire
rebuke those faithless souls , whose querulous wail
ABBA
disturbs your sacred sleep !— “ the withering hail
of battle , hunger , pestilence , despair
whatever of mortal anguish man may bear
we bore unmurmuring ! strengthened by the mail
ABBA
of a most holy purpose !— then we died
vex not our rest by cries of selfish pain
but to the noblest measure of your powers
endure the appointed trial ! griefs defied
ABBA
thank god , he saw you last in pomp of may
ere any leaf had felt the year 's regret
your latest image in his memory set
was fair as when your landscape 's peaceful sway
ABBA
charmed dearer eyes with his to make delay
on hope 's long prospect ,— as if they forget
the happy , they , the unspeakable three , whose debt
like the hawk 's shadow , blots our brightest day
ABBA
better it is that ye should look so fair
slopes that he loved , and ever murmuring pines
that make a music out of silent air
and bloom heaped orchard trees in prosperous lines
ABAB
unquiet thought ! whom at the first i bred
of th'inward bale of my love pined hart
and sithens have with sighes and sorrowes fed
till greater then my wombe thou woxen art
ABAB
breake forth at length out of the inner part
in which thou lurkest lyke to vipers brood
and seeke some succour both to ease my smart
and also to sustayne thy selfe with food
ABAB
the soul 's rialto hath its merchandize
i barter curl for curl upon that mart
and from my poet 's forehead to my heart
receive this lock which outweighs argosies
ABBA
as purply black , as erst to pindar 's eyes
the dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart
the nine white muse brows . for this counterpart
the bay crown 's shade , beloved , i surmise
ABBA
still lingers on thy curl , it is so black
thus , with a fillet of smooth kissing breath
i tie the shadows safe from gliding back
and lay the gift where nothing hindereth
ABAB
sends forth his active mind from place to place
joins hill to dale , and measures space with space
so swift flew juno to the bless ’ d abodes
if thought of man can match the speed of gods
AABB
“ lady , i swear your saad 's horse
the prophet himself might have rode a worse
like the knots of a serpent the play of his flesh
as he tore to the quarry in allah 's mesh
AABB
i forgot him , and mowed at the traitor weeds
which fell before me like rushes and reeds
or like the tall poppies that sudden drop low
their heads to an urchin 's unstrung bow
AABB
fled the giaour ; the faithful flew after to kill
i turned to surrender : beneath me still
was abdon unjaded , fresh in force
faithful and fearless — a heavenly horse
AABB
ay , and dim through my daylight thoughts escape
yearnings for that land where my childhood dreamed
which i cannot recall in colour or shape
but haunts my hours like something that hath gleamed
ABAB
one day i wrote her name upon the strand
but came the waves and washed it away
agayne i wrote it with a second hand
but came the tyde , and made my paynes his pray
ABAB
“ not so , ” quod i ; “ let baser things devize
to dy in dust , but you shall live by fame
my verse your vertues rare shall eternize
and in the hevens wryte your glorious name
ABAB
o that i had the thracian poets harpe
for to awake out of th'infernall shade
those antique caesars , sleeping long in darke
the which this auncient citie whilome made
ABAB
or that at least i could with pencill fine
fashion the pourtraicts of these palacis
by paterne of great virgils spirit divine
i would assay with that which in me is
ABAB
shall i depict the anguish of the brave
who envied comrades sleeping in the grave
shall i exult o'er inoffensive dust
of valiant men whose swords have turned to rust
AABB
shall i , like menelaus by the coast
o'er dead ajaces make unmanly boast
shall i , in chains of an ignoble verse
degrade dead hectors , and their pangs rehearse
AABB
nay ! such is not the mood this people feels
their chariots drag no foemen by the heels
let ajax slumber by the sounding sea
from the fell passion of his madness free
AABB
the paynefull smith with force of fervent heat
the hardest yron soone doth mollify
that with his heavy sledge he can it beat
and fashion to what he it list apply
ABAB
yet cannot all these flames in which i fry
her hart , more hard then yron , soft a whit
ne all the playnts and pray ë rs with which i
doe beat on th'andvile of her stubberne wit
ABAB
but still , the more she fervent sees my fit
the more she frieseth in her wilfull pryde
and harder growes , the harder she is smit
with all the playnts which to her be applyde
ABAB
‘ flow from the rock , my flax ! and swiftly flow
pursue thy thread , the spindle runs below
a creature fond and changing , fair and vain
the creature woman , rises now to reign
AABB
new beauty blooms , a beauty form 'd to fly
new love begins , a love produced to die
new parts distress the troubled scenes of life
the fondling mistress , and the ruling wife
AABB
men , born to labour , all with pains provide
women have time to sacrifice to pride
they want the care of man , their want they know
and dress to please with heart alluring show
AABB
alaciel 's story 's of another kind
and i 've a little altered it , you 'll find
faults some may see , and others disbelieve
‘ tis all the same :— ‘ twill never make me grieve
AABB
alaciel 's mem'ry , it is very clear
can scarcely by it lose ; there 's naught to fear
two facts important i have kept in view
in which the author fully i pursue
AABB
the one — no less than eight the belle possessed
before a husband 's sight her eyes had blessed
the other is , the prince she was to wed
ne'er seemed to heed this trespass on his bed
AABB
let the sublimer muse , who , wrapp 'd in night
rides on the raven pennons of the storm
or o'er the field , with purple havoc warm
lashes her steeds , and sings along the fight
ABBA
let her , whom more ferocious strains delight
disdain the plaintive sonnet 's little form
and scorn to its wild cadence to conform
the impetuous tenor of her hardy flight
ABBA
but me , far lowest of the sylvan train
who wake the wood nymphs from the forest shade
with wildest song ;— me , much behoves thy aid
of mingled melody , to grace my strain
ABBA
why dost thou , delia , credit so thy glass
gazing thy beauty deigned thee by the skies
and dost not rather look on him , alas
whose state best shows the force of murdering eyes
ABAB
the broken tops of lofty trees declare
the fury of a mercy wanting storm
and of what force thy wounding graces are
upon myself , you best may find the form
ABAB
then leave thy glass , and gaze thyself on me
that mirror shows what power is in thy face
to view your form too much may danger be
narcissus changed t'a flower in such a case
ABAB
did you but know the virtuous steps she trod
while thus devoted to the little god
you 'd thank a hundred times the pow'rs above
that gave you such a child to bless your love
AABB
but many other customs there abound
the fair with perfect liberty are found
can go and come , whene'er the humour fits
no eunuch ( shadow like ) that never quits
AABB
but watches ev'ry movement :— always feared
no men , but who 've upon the chin a beard
your daughter from the first , their manners took
so easy is her ev'ry act and look
AABB
among the lonely lakes i go no more
for she who made their beauty is not there
the paleface rears his tepee on the shore
and says the vale is fairest of the fair
ABAB
full many years have vanished since , but still
the voyageurs beside the campfire tell
how , when the moonrise tips the distant hill
they hear strange voices through the silence swell
ABAB
the paleface loves the haunted lakes they say
and journeys far to watch their beauty spread
before his vision ; but to me the day
the night , the hour , the seasons are all dead
ABAB
“ o king ! to mercy be thy soul inclined
and spare the poet 's ever gentle kind
a deed like this thy future fame would wrong
for dear to gods and men is sacred song
AABB
self taught i sing ; by heaven , and heaven alone
the genuine seeds of poesy are sown
and ( what the gods bestow ) the lofty lay
to gods alone and godlike worth we pay
AABB
save then the poet , and thyself reward
‘ tis thine to merit , mine is to record
that here i sung , was force , and not desire
this hand reluctant touch 'd the warbling wire
AABB
the merry cuckow , messenger of spring
his trompet shrill hath thrise already sounded
that warnes al lovers wayte upon their king
who now is coming forth with girland crouned
ABAB
though night approaching bids for rest prepare
still the flail echoes through the frosty air
nor stops till deepest shades of darkness come
sending at length the weary laborer home
AABB
from him , with bed and nightly food supplied
throughout the yard , hous 'd round on every side
deep plunging cows their rustling feast enjoy
and snatch sweet mouthfuls from the passing boy
AABB
who moves unseen beneath his trailing load
fills the tall racks , and leaves a scatter 'd road
where oft the swine from ambush warm and dry
bolt out , and scamper headlong to their sty
AABB
the suffering chief at this began to melt
and , “ o eumaeus ! thou ( he cries ) hast felt
the spite of fortune too ! her cruel hand
snatch 'd thee an infant from thy native land
AABB
where once thy parents dwelt ? or did they keep
in humbler life , the lowing herds and sheep
so left perhaps to tend the fleecy train
rude pirates seized , and shipp 'd thee o'er the main
AABB
what can i give thee back , o liberal
and princely giver , who hast brought the gold
and purple of thine heart , unstained , untold
and laid them on the outside of the wall
ABBA
not so ; not cold ,— but very poor instead
ask god who knows . for frequent tears have run
the colours from my life , and left so dead
and pale a stuff , it were not fitly done
ABAB
then let not winter 's ragged hand deface
in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
make sweet some vial ; treasure thou some place
with beauty 's treasure ere it be self killed
ABAB
ten times thy self were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living in posterity
ABAB
he spoke , and all , as with one soul , obey ’ d
their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade
around the chief . æ neas too demands
th ’ assisting forces of his native bands
AABB
paris , deiphobus , agenor , join
( co aids and captains of the trojan line
in order follow all th ’ embodied train
like ida ’ s flocks proceeding o ’ er the plain
AABB
before his fleecy care , erect and bold
stalks the proud ram , the father of the bold
with joy the swain surveys them , as he leads
to the cool fountains , through the well known meads
AABB
i know not why — but time , methinks , hath past
more fleet than usual since we parted last
it seems but like a dream of yesternight
whose charm still hangs , with fond , delaying light
AABB
and , ere the memory lose one glowing hue
of former joy , we come to kindle new
thus ever may the flying moments haste
with trackless foot along life 's vulgar waste
AABB
but deeply print and lingeringly move
when thus they reach the sunny spots we love
oh yes , whatever be our gay career
let this be still the solstice of the year
AABB
be it known , that the great biped lords of creation
of every class , and in every station
all secretly cherish , what all yet disclaim
that feeling , which we curiosity name
AABB
now our peacock imperial , tho ’ too proud to own
that the fav'rite of juno had ever been prone
to a weakness , he always had wish 'd to believe
was exclusively felt by the daughters of eve
AABB
yet died with impatience to know who had written
the elegant verses , with which he was smitten
his thoughts were all now on discovery bent
and , in haste , for the parrot he instantly sent
AABB
each soul i might have succored , may have slain
all souls shall face me at the last appeal
that great last moment poised for woe or weal
that final moment for man 's bliss or bane
ABBA
vanity of vanities , yea all is vain
which then will not avail or help or heal
disfeatured faces , worn out knees that kneel
will more avail than strength or beauty then
ABBA
lord , by thy passion ,— when thy face was marred
in sight of earth and hell tumultuous
and thy heart failed in thee like melting wax
and thy blood dropped more precious than the nard
ABBA
‘ tis holy ground ! the silent silver lights
and darks undreamed of , falling year by year
upon his sleep , in soft australian nights
are joys enough for him who lieth here
ABAB
thy gift , thy tables , are within my brain
full charactered with lasting memory
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date even to eternity
ABAB
or at the least , so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee , thy record never can be missed
ABAB
that poor retention could not so much hold
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score
therefore to give them from me was i bold
to trust those tables that receive thee more
ABAB
i feel the well known breeze , and the sweet hill
again appears , where rose that beauteous light
which , while heaven willed it , met my eyes , then bright
with gladness , but now dimmed with many an ill
ABBA
vain hopes ! weak thoughts ! now , turbid is the rill
the flowers have drooped ; and she hath ta'en her flight
from the cold nest , which once , in proud delight
living and dying , i had hoped to fill
ABBA
i hoped , in these retreats , and in the blaze
of her fair eyes , which have consumed my heart
to taste the sweet reward of troubled days
thou , whom i serve , how hard and proud thou art
ABAB
on other shores , above their mouldering towns
in sullen pomp the tall cathedral frowns
pride in its aisles and paupers at the door
which feeds the beggars whom it fleeced of yore
AABB
simple and frail , our lowly temples throw
their slender shadows on the paths below
scarce steal the winds , that sweep his woodland tracks
the larch 's perfume from the settler 's axe
AABB
ere , like a vision of the morning air
his slight — framed steeple marks the house of prayer
its planks all reeking and its paint undried
its rafters sprouting on the shady side
AABB
as to the roman that would free his land
his error was his honour and renown
and more the fame of his mistaking hand
than if he had the tyrant overthrown
ABAB
so delia , hath mine error made me known
and my deceived attempt deserved more fame
than if had the victory mine own
and thy hard heart had yielded up the same
ABAB
and so likewise renowned is thy blame
thy cruelty , thy glory ; o strange case
that errors should be graced that merit shame
and sin of frowns bring honour to the face
ABAB
the hope of truth grows stronger , day by day
i hear the soul of man around me waking
like a great sea , its frozen fetters breaking
and flinging up to heaven its sunlit spray
ABBA
tossing huge continents in scornful play
and crushing them , with din of grinding thunder
that makes old emptinesses stare in wonder
the memory of a glory passed away
ABBA
lingers in every heart , as , in the shell
resounds the bygone freedom of the sea
and every hour new signs of promise tell
that the great soul shall once again be free
ABAB
“ o soul of battles , and thy people ’ s guide
( to ajax thus the first of greeks replied
well hast thou spoke ; but at the tyrant ’ s name
my rage rekindles , and my soul ’ s on flame
AABB
’ tis just resentment , and becomes the brave
disgraced , dishonour ’ d , like the vilest slave
return , then , heroes ! and our answer bear
the glorious combat is no more my care
AABB
not till , amidst yon sinking navy slain
the blood of greeks shall dye the sable main
not till the flames , by hector ’ s fury thrown
consume your vessels , and approach my own
AABB
my heart mine eye accuseth of his death
saying his wanton sight bred his unrest
mine eye affirms my heart 's unconstant faith
hath been his bane , and all his joys repressed
ABAB
my heart avows mine eye let in the fire
which burns him with an everliving light
mine eye replies my greedy heart 's desire
let in those floods , which drown him day and night
ABAB
thus wars my heart which reason doth maintain
and calls my eye to combat if he dare
the whilst my soul impatient of disdain
wrings from his bondage unto death more near
ABAB
“ we people that work , ” said the bee with a jerk
“ find a benefit sometimes in stopping
only insects like you , who have nothing to do
can keep perpetually hopping
ABAB
the grasshopper paused on his way
and thoughtfully hunched up his knees
“ why trouble this sunshiny day
quoth he , “ with reflections like these
ABAB
september , with her pomp of fields and farms
and wild november 's sybilline array
in spite of beauty 's calendar , the year
garlands with beauty 's prize the bonny may
ABAB
since last i saw that countenance so mild
slow stealing age , and a faint line of care
had gently touched , methought , some features there
yet looked the man as placid as a child
ABBA
and the same voice ,— whilst mingled with the throng
unknowing , and unknown , we passed along
that voice , a share of the brief time beguiled
that voice i ne'er may hear again , i sighed
AABB
at parting ,— wheresoe'er our various way
in this great world ,— but from the banks of tweed
as slowly sink the shades of eventide
oh ! i shall hear the music of his reed
ABAB
the prayers i make will then be sweet indeed
if thou the spirit give by which i pray
my unassisted heart is barren clay
which of its native self can nothing feed
ABBA
of good and pious works thou art the seed
which quickens only where thou say'st it may
unless thou shew to us thine own true way
no man can find it : father ! thou must lead
ABBA
do thou , then , breathe those thoughts into my mind
by which such virtue may in me be bred
that in thy holy footsteps i may tread
the fetters of my tongue do thou unbind
ABBA
not from the stars do i my judgement pluck
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good , or evil luck
of plagues , of dearths , or seasons ’ quality
ABAB
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell
pointing to each his thunder , rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
ABAB
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
if from thy self , to store thou wouldst convert
ABAB
pride of thy race ! with worth far less than thine
full many human leaders daily shine
less faith , less constancy , less gen'rous zeal
then no disgrace mine humble verse shall feel
AABB
where not one lying line to riches bows
or poison 'd sentiment from rancour flows
nor flowers are strewn around ambition 's car
an honest dog 's a nobler theme by far
AABB
each sportsman heard the tidings with a sigh
when death 's cold touch had stopt his tuneful cry
and though high deeds , and fair exalted praise
in memory liv 'd , and flow 'd in rustic lays
AABB
poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
my sinful earth these rebel powers array
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
ABAB
why so large cost having so short a lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge ? is this thy body 's end
ABAB
then soul live thou upon thy servant 's loss
and let that pine to aggravate thy store
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
within be fed , without be rich no more
ABAB
maids shout to breakfast in a merry strife
and the cat runs to hear the whetted knife
and dogs are ever in the way to watch
the mouldy crust and falling bone to catch
AABB
the wooden dishes round in haste are set
and round the table all the boys are met
all know their own save hodge who would be first
but every one his master leaves the worst
AABB
on every wooden dish , a humble claim
two rude cut letters mark the owner 's name
from every nook the smile of plenty calls
and rusty flitches decorate the walls
AABB
no sooner spreads her glory in the air
but straight her wide blown pomp comes to decline
she then is scorned that late adorned the fair
so fade the roses of those cheeks of thine
ABAB
no april can revive thy withered flowers
whose springing grace adorns thy glory now
swift speedy time , feathered with flying hours
dissolves the beauty of the fairest brow
ABAB
meantime the train , proceeding on their way
from far the town and lofty tow'rs survey
at length approach the walls . without the gate
they see the boys and latian youth debate
AABB
the martial prizes on the dusty plain
some drive the cars , and some the coursers rein
some bend the stubborn bow for victory
and some with darts their active sinews try
AABB
a posting messenger , dispatch 'd from hence
of this fair troop advis 'd their aged prince
that foreign men of mighty stature came
uncouth their habit , and unknown their name
AABB
hark to the sound that speedeth o'er the land
behold the sword in fratricidal hand
‘ tis duty calls thee , lincoln , and thy trust
demands that all thy acts be wise and just
AABB
no idle task to thee has been assigned
but work that 's worthy of a giant mind
and on the issue hangs the nation 's fame
as a free people who deserve the name
AABB
so , walk thou in the way the fathers trod
be true to freedom , country , and to god
then truth will triumph , treason be undone
and thou be hailed the second washington
AABB
thee i invoke , the lord of life and light
beyond imagination pure and bright
to thee , sufficing praise no tongue can give
we are thy creatures , and in thee we live
AABB
thou art the summit , depth , the all in all
creator , guardian of this earthly ball
whatever is , thou art — protector , king
from thee all goodness , truth , and mercy spring
AABB
o pardon the misdeeds of him who now
bends in thy presence with a suppliant brow
teach them to tread the path thy prophet trod
to wash his heart from sin , to know his god
AABB
o melancholy bird , a winter 's day
thou standest by the margin of the pool
and , taught by god , dost thy whole being school
to patience , which all evil can allay
ABBA
god has appointed thee the fish thy prey
and given thyself a lesson to the fool
unthrifty , to submit to moral rule
and his unthinking course by thee to weigh
ABBA
there need not schools , nor the professor 's chair
though these be good , true wisdom to impart
he , who has not enough for these to spare
of time , or gold , may yet amend his heart
ABAB
as the lone , frighted user of a night road
suddenly turns round , nothing to detect
yet on his fear ’ s sense keepeth still the load
of that brink nothing he doth but suspect
ABAB
so i upon the world turn round in thought
and nothing viewing do no courage take
but my more terror , from no seen cause got
to that felt corporate emptiness forsake
ABAB
woe for thee , babylon !— thy men of might
shall fall unhonoured in the sanguine fight
like the chased roe thy hosts disordered fly
and those who turn to strive but turn to die
AABB
thy young men tremble and thy maids grow pale
and swell with frantic grief thy funeral wail
they kneel for mercy , but they sue in vain
their beauty withers on the gore dyed plain
AABB
with fathers , lovers , brothers , meet their doom
and ‘ mid thy blackened ruins find a tomb
of fear unconscious , in soft slumbers blest
the infant dies upon its mother 's breast
AABB
the breed 's described : now , satire , if you can
their temper show , for manners make the man
fierce as the briton , as the roman brave
and less inclined to conquer than to save
AABB
what honesty they have , the saxon gave them
and that , now they grow old , begins to leave them
the climate makes them terrible and bold
and english beef their courage does uphold
AABB
sweet summer queen , with trailing robe of green
what spell has thou to bind the heart to thee
thy throne is built upon the sun lit sea
where break the waves in clouds of silver sheen
ABBA
and oft at dawn like some resplendent queen
thou sittest on the hills in majesty
and all the flowers wake at thy decree
but now farewell to all thy joys serene
ABBA
the autumn comes with swift winged , silent flight
and he will woo thee with his fiery breath
in crimson robes and hues of flashing gold
he 'll clothe thee , and thy beauty in the night
ABBA
beloved moment ! then ‘ twas first i caught
the first foundation of romantic thought
then first i shed bold fancy 's thrilling tear
then first that poesy charm 'd mine infant ear
AABB
soon stored with much of legendary lore
the sports of childhood charm 'd my soul no more
far from the scene of gaiety and noise
far , far from turbulent and empty joys
AABB
i hied me to the thick overarching shade
and there , on mossy carpet , listless laid
while at my feet the rippling runnel ran
the days of wild romance antique i 'd scan
AABB
the rolling wheele that runneth often round
the hardest steele , in tract of time doth teare
and drizling drops , that often doe redound
the firmest flint doth in continuance weare
ABAB
yet cannot i , with many a drooping teare
and long intreaty , soften her hard hart
that she will once vouchsafe my plaint to heare
or looke with pitty on my payneful smart
ABAB
but when i pleade , she bids me play my part
and when i weep , she sayes , teares are but water
and when i sigh , she sayes , i know the art
and when i waile , she turnes hir selfe to laughter
ABAB
“ only hope of our age , that virtues dead
by your sweet breath should be revived again
learning discouraged long by rude disdain
by your white hands is only cherish è d
ABBA
thus others ’ worth by you is honour è d
but who shall honour yours ? poor wits , in vain
we seek to pay the debts which you pertain
till from yourself some wealth be borrow è d
ABBA
lend some your tongues , that every nation may
in his own hear your virtuous praises blaze
lend them your wit , your judgment , memory
lest they themselves should not know what to say
ABBA
o true , they have a cause , and woe for us
while still they have a cause too piteous
yet , happy for us when , their cause defined
they walk no longer with a stumbler blind
AABB
and quicken in the virtue of their cause
to think me a poor mouther of old saws
i wait the issue of a battling age
the toilers with your “ troughsters ” now engage
AABB
instructing them through their acutest sense
how close the dangers of indifference
already have my people shown their worth
more love they light , which folds the love of earth
AABB
reignin my thoughts , fair hand , sweet eye , rare voice
possess me whole , my heart 's triumvirate
yet heavy heart , to make so hard a choice
of such as spoil thy poor afflicted state
ABAB
for whilst they strive which shall be lord of all
all my poor life by them is trodden down
they all erect their trophies on my fall
and yield me nought that gives them their renown
ABAB
when back i look , i sigh my freedom past
and wail the state wherein i present stand
and see my fortune ever like to last
finding me reined with such a heavy hand
ABAB
then all the lords and ladies rubbed their eyes
and slowly roused themselves from dumb surprise
the great hall echoed once more with the clatter
of laughing men 's and frightened women 's chatter
AABB
but gawayne , with the axe in hand , stood still
heedless of what was passing , with no will
for life or death , for all that made life dear
was fled like summer when the leaves fall sere
AABB
and arthur spoke , misreading gawayne 's thought
“ heaven send we have not all too dearly bought
our evening 's pastime , gawayne . you have done
as fits a fearless knight , and nobly won
AABB
faire proud ! now tell me , why should faire be proud
sith all worlds glorie is but drosse uncleane
and in the shade of death it selfe shall shroud
however now thereof ye little weene
ABAB
as that brave sonne of aeson , which by charmes
atcheiv 'd the golden fleece in colchid land
out of the earth engendred men of armes
of dragons teeth , sowne in the sacred sand
ABAB
as when it happ'neth that some lovely town
unto a barbarous besieger falls
who both by sword and flame himself installs
and , shameless , it in tears and blood doth drown
ABBA
her beauty spoil 'd , her citizens made thralls
his spite yet cannot so her all throw down
but that some statue , pillar of renown
yet lurks unmaim 'd within her weeping walls
ABBA
so , after all the spoil , disgrace , and wreck
that time , the world , and death , could bring combined
amidst that mass of ruins they did make
safe and all scarless yet remains my mind
ABAB
that you were once unkind befriends me now
and for that sorrow , which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow
unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
ABAB
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours , y'have passed a hell of time
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
ABAB
o that our night of woe might have remembered
my deepest sense , how hard true sorrow hits
and soon to you , as you to me then tendered
the humble salve , which wounded bosoms fits
ABAB
she stood before her traitors bound and bare
clothed with her wounds and with her naked shame
as with a weed of fiery tears and flame
their mother land , their common weal and care
ABBA
and they turned from her and denied , and sware
they did not know this woman nor her name
and they took truce with tyrants and grew tame
and gathered up cast crowns and creeds to wear
ABBA
and rags and shards regilded . then she took
in her bruised hands their broken pledge , and eyed
these men so late so loud upon her side
with one inevitable and tearless look
ABBA
the peasant ‘ gan to turn things in his mind
said he , to take the heads i 'm not inclined
no drink , you say , between ; that makes it worse
to eat the garlick thus , would prove a curse
AABB
nor can i suffer on my tender back
that , with a cudgel , thirty blows you thwack
still harder thirty pounds to pay appeared
uncertain how to act , he hanging feared
AABB
the noble peer he begged , upon his knees
his penitence to hear , and sentence ease
but mercy dwelled not with the angry lord
is this , cried he , the answer ?— bring a cord
AABB
and yet this time removed was summer 's time
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widowed wombs after their lords ’ decease
ABAB
yet this abundant issue seemed to me
but hope of orphans , and unfathered fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
and thou away , the very birds are mute
ABAB
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces
ABAB
so should my papers ( yellowed with their age
be scorned , like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be termed a poet 's rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
ABAB
mary ! i want a lyre with other strings
such aid from heaven as some have feigned they drew
an eloquence scarce given to mortals , new
and undebased by praise of meaner things
ABBA
that , ere through age or woe i shed my wings
i may record thy worth with honor due
in verse as musical as thou art true
and that immortalizes whom it sings
ABBA
but thou hast little need . there is a book
by seraphs writ with beams of heavenly light
on which the eyes of god not rarely look
a chronicle of actions just and bright
ABAB
the spirit 's ark sealed with a little clay
was old ere memphis grew a memory
the hand pontifical to break away
that seal what shall surrender ? not the sea
ABAB
which did englut great egypt and his war
nor all the desert drown ed sepulchres
love 's feet are stained with clay and travel sore
and dusty are song 's lucent wing and hairs
ABAB
o love , that must do courtesy to decay
eat hasty bread standing with loins up girt
how shall this stead thy feet for their sore way
ah , song , what brief embraces balm thy hurt
ABAB
thus toil ’ d the chiefs , in different parts engaged
in every quarter fierce tydides raged
amid the greek , amid the trojan train
rapt through the ranks he thunders o ’ er the plain
AABB
now here , now there , he darts from place to place
pours on the rear , or lightens in their face
thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong
deluge whole fields , and sweep the trees along
AABB
through ruin ’ d moles the rushing wave resounds
o ’ erwhelm ’ s the bridge , and bursts the lofty bounds
the yellow harvests of the ripen ’ d year
and flatted vineyards , one sad waste appear
AABB
timid and smiling , beautiful and shy
she drops her head at every passer bye
afraid of praise she hurries down the streets
and turns away from every smile she meets
AABB
the forward clown has many things to say
and holds her by the gown to make her stay
the picture of good health she goes along
hale as the morn and happy as her song
AABB
yet there is one who never feels a fear
to whisper pleasing fancies in her ear
yet een from him she shuns a rude embrace
and stooping holds her hands before her face
AABB
“ smooth roll 'd my vernal years , while on my head
fate 's early smiles a meteor lustre shed
no painful fear , no troubles , then had power
to break the current of one peaceful hour
AABB
oft as i trod the meadow 's verdant round
or pierced the echoing forest 's gloomy bound
or traced the willowy margin of the stream
lost in the wildering maze of fancy 's dream
AABB
before me life 's long years in prospect rose
by fears unbroken , undisturb 'd by woes
yes ! i remember well ,— my dizzy brain
feels those bright hours not yet effaced by pain
AABB
friend of my peaceful days ! substantial friend
whom wealth can never change , nor int'rest bend
i love thee like a child . thou wert to me
the dumb companion of my misery
AABB
and oftner of my joys ;— then as i spoke
i shar 'd thy sympathy , old heart of oak
for surely when my labour ceas 'd at night
with trembling , feverish hands , and aching sight
AABB
the draught that cheer 'd me and subdu 'd my care
on thy broad shoulders thou wert proud to bear
o'er thee , with expectation 's fire elate
i 've sat and ponder 'd on my future fate
AABB
i say unto all hearts that cannot rest
for want of love , for beating loud and lonely
pray the great mercy god to give you only
love that is passionless within the breast
ABBA
pray that it may not be a haunting fire
a vision that shall steal insatiably
all beauteous content , all sweet desire
from faith and dream , star , flower , and song , and sea
ABAB
but seek that soul and soul may meet together
knowing they have forever been but one
meet and be surest when ill 's chartless weather
drives blinding gales of doubt across their sun
ABAB
there valor fronts us with her storied shield
brave in devices won on many a field
a splendid wreath snatched from the carnage grim
is twined around that buckler 's burnished rim
AABB
and as we gaze , the brazen trumpets blare
with shrill vibration shakes the frightened air
the roll of musketry — the clash of steel
the clang of hoofs as charging squadrons wheel
AABB
the hoarse command — the imprecative cry
swell loud and long , while fancy 's eager eye
sees the stern van move on with crimson strides
where freedom 's warrior on his war horse rides
AABB
to one who has been long in city pent
‘ tis very sweet to look into the fair
and open face of heaven ,— to breathe a prayer
full in the smile of the blue firmament
ABBA
who is more happy , when , with hearts content
fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
of wavy grass , and reads a debonair
and gentle tale of love and languishment
ABBA
returning home at evening , with an ear
catching the notes of philomel ,— an eye
watching the sailing cloudlet 's bright career
he mourns that day so soon has glided by
ABAB
a rose , as fair as ever saw the north
grew in a little garden all alone
a sweeter flower did nature ne'er put forth
nor fairer garden yet was never known
ABAB
the maidens danced about it morn and noon
and learned bards of it their ditties made
the nimble fairies by the pale faced moon
watered the root and kissed her pretty shade
ABAB
but well a day !— the gardener careless grew
the maids and fairies both were kept away
and in a drought the caterpillars threw
themselves upon the bud and every spray
ABAB
straight from the sun 's grave in the deep clear west
a sweet strong wind blows , glad of life : and i
under the soft keen stardawn whence the sky
takes life renewed , and all night 's godlike breast
ABBA
palpitates , gradually revealed at rest
by growth and change of ardours felt on high
make onward , till the last flame fall and die
and all the world by night 's broad hand lie blest
ABBA
haply , meseems , as from that edge of death
whereon the day lies dark , a brightening breath
blows more of benediction than the morn
so from the graves whereon grief gazing saith
AABB
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes
and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he
remembered in what a haughtier guise
he had flung an alms to leprosie
ABAB
when he girt his young life up in gilded mail
and set forth in search of the holy grail
the heart within him was ashes and dust
he parted in twain his single crust
AABB
he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink
and gave the leper to eat and drink
‘ twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread
‘ twas water out of a wooden bowl
AABB
‘ tis best sometimes your censure to restrain
and charitably let the dull be vain
your silence there is better than your spite
for who can rail so long as they can write
AABB
still humming on , their drowsy course they keep
and lashed so long like tops are lashed asleep
false steps but help them to renew the race
as after stumbling , jades will mend their pace
AABB
what crowds of these , impenitently bold
in sounds and jingling syllables grown old
still run on poets in a raging vein
even to the dregs and squeezing of the brain
AABB
lear and cordelia ! ‘ twas an ancient tale
before thy shakespeare gave it deathless fame
the times have changed , the moral is the same
so like an outcast , dowerless and pale
ABBA
thy daughter went ; and in a foreign gale
spread her young banner , till its sway became
a wonder to the nations . days of shame
are close upon thee ; prophets raise their wail
ABBA
when the rude cossack with an outstretched hand
points his long spear across the narrow sea
“ lo ! there is england ! ” when thy destiny
storms on thy straw crowned head , and thou dost stand
ABBA
in thine own pure form to the eye of sense
from its resting place has departed hence
and twitters the swallow , and wheels the bat
o'er the mercy seat where its presence sat
AABB
i have marked thy trembling breast , and heard
with a heart responsive thy tones , sweet bird
and have mourned , like thee , of earth 's fairest things
the blight and the loss — oh ! had i thy wings
AABB
wise men the shepherd 's slumber will deplore
when the rapacious wolf has leapt the fence
and ranges thro ’ the fold .— my son , dispense
those laws , that justice to the wrong 'd restore
ABBA
the common weal shou 'd be the first pursuit
of the crown 'd warrior , for the royal brows
the people first enwreath 'd .— they are the root
the king the tree . aloft he spreads his boughs
ABAB
low mourned the oread round the arcadian hills
the naiad murmured and the dryad moaned
the meadow maiden left her daffodils
to join the hamadryades who groaned
ABAB
over a sister newly fallen dead
that life might perish out of arcady
from immemorial times was never said
yet here one lay dead by her dead oak tree
ABAB
“ who made our hamadryad cold and mute
the others cried in sorrow and in wonder
“ i , ” answered death , close by in ashen suit
“ yet fear not me for this , nor start asunder
ABAB
around her grew a stillness unto death
the waves their ever restless motion stayed
all living nature seemed to hold its breath
as if by some stupendous power o'erweighed
ABAB
and right athwart the sunset 's fading glow
a great black cloud , like some huge monstrous thing
threw round and round the sun 's last dipping ring
the impress of its shadow drooping low
ABBA
and lower , lower fell that mighty cloud
with menacing shape as in defiance proud
until at last all sky and earth and sea
seemed filled with shadows from its darkening wings
AABB
on which when as my thought was throghly @ placed
unto my eyes strange showes presented were
picturing that which i in minde embraced
that yet those sights empassion $ me full nere
ABAB
rend hearts and rend not garments for our sins
gird sackcloth not on body but on soul
grovel in dust with faces toward the goal
nor won , nor neared : he only laughs who wins
ABBA
not neared the goal , the race too late begins
or left undone , we have yet to do the whole
the sun is hurrying west and toward the pole
where darkness waits for earth with all her kins
ABBA
let us to day , while it is called to day
set out , if utmost speed may yet avail
the shadows lengthen and the light grows pale
for who through darkness and the shadow of death
ABBA
“ daddy , come out ! daddy darling , you must
daddy come out and help molly pick daisies
and , since one 's here , and the spring 's in the garden
( how many lives hence will that thought earn pardon
AABB
since one 's a man and man 's heart is insistent
and , since nirvana is doubtful and distant
though life 's a hard road and thorny to travel
stones in the borders and grass on the gravel
AABB
not that thy hand is soft , is sweet , is white
thy lips sweet roses , breast sweet lily is
that love esteems these three the chiefest bliss
which nature ever made for lips ’ delight
ABBA
but when these three to show their heavenly might
such wonders do , devotion then for this
commandeth us with humble zeal to kiss
such things as work miracles in our sight
ABBA
a lute of senseless wood , by nature dumb
touched by thy hand doth speak divinely well
and from thy lips and breast sweet tunes do come
to my dead heart , the which new life do give
ABAB
shout , for a mighty victory is won
on british ground the invaders are laid low
the breath of heaven has drifted them like snow
and left them lying in the silent sun
ABBA
never to rise again !— the work is done
come forth , ye old men , now in peaceful show
and greet your sons ! drums beat , and trumpets blow
make merry , wives ! ye little children stun
ABBA
your grandame 's ears with pleasure of your noise
clap , infants , clap your hands ! divine must be
that triumph , when the very worst , the pain
and even the prospect of our brethren slain
AABB
a woman i forswore ; but i will prove
thou being a goddess , i forswore not thee
my vow was earthly , thou a heavenly love
thy grace being gain 'd cures all disgrace in me
ABAB
my vow was breath , and breath a vapour is
then , thou fair sun , that on this earth doth shine
exhale this vapour vow ; in thee it is
if broken , then it is no fault of mine
ABAB
one looks into the sun lawn , and the steep
curved slopes of hills , set sharp against the sky
with tufted woods encinctured , waving high
o'er vales below , where broken shadows sleep
ABBA
here , looking forth before the first faint cry
of mother bird , fluttering a drowsy wing
above her brood , awakes the full voiced choir
ere yet the morning tips the hills with fire
AABB
and turns the drapery of the east to gold
my wondering eyes the opening heavens behold
where far within deep calleth unto deep
and the whole world stands hushed and worshipping
AABB
the weary old year is dead at last
his corpse ‘ mid the ruins of time is cast
where the mouldering wrecks of lost thought lie
and the rich hued blossoms of passion die
AABB
to a withering grass that droops o'er his grave
the shadowy titan 's refuge cave
strange lights from pale moony memory lie
on the weedy columns beneath its eye
AABB
and strange is the sound of the ghostlike breeze
in the lingering leaves on the skeleton trees
and strange is the sound of the falling shower
when the clouds of dead pain o'er the spirit lower
AABB
e'en i who speak , alas ! have troubles met
within my bosom oft i feel regret
three children ere my marriage i had got
have i your father told this secret blot
AABB
have we together been less happy found
the list'ner had no sooner heard the sound
but like a man distracted off he flew
the saddle 's girth , which hazard near him threw
AABB
he took and fastened tightly ‘ bout his waist
then bawled around and round with anxious haste
i 'm girth 'd ! d'ye see , completely taken in
the people stared , an ‘ gan to laugh and grin
AABB
mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
thy beauty 's form in table of my heart
my body is the frame wherein ‘ tis held
and perspective it is best painter 's art
ABAB
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosom 's shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
ABAB
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape , and thine for me
are windows to my breast , where through the sun
delights to peep , to gaze therein on thee
ABAB
i hate the very noise of troublous man
who did and does me all the harm he can
free from the world i would a prisoner be
and my own shadow all my company
AABB
and lonely see the shooting stars appear
worlds rushing into judgment all the year
o lead me onward to the loneliest shade
the darkest place that quiet ever made
AABB
where kingcups grow most beauteous to behold
and shut up green and open into gold
farewell to poesy — and leave the will
take all the world away — and leave me still
AABB
thus vulcan spoke : and rising with a bound
the double bowl with sparkling nectar crown ’ d
which held to juno in a cheerful way
“ goddess ( he cried ) , be patient and obey
AABB
dear as you are , if jove his arm extend
i can but grieve , unable to defend
what god so daring in your aid to move
or lift his hand against the force of jove
AABB
once in your cause i felt his matchless might
hurl ’ d headlong down from the ethereal height
toss ’ d all the day in rapid circles round
nor till the sun descended touch ’ d the ground
AABB
the combat ceased , the thunder birds had won
the water demon with one favorite son
fled from the carnage and escaped our wrath
the vapors , thinly curling from the shore
AABB
faint musky odors to our nostrils bore
the air was stilled , the silence of the dead
the sun , just starting on his downward path
a rosy mantle o'er the prairie shed
ABAB
save where , like vultures , ominous and still
we clustered close , on sullen wings outspread
and sometimes , with a momentary chill
a giant shadow swept o'er plain and hill
AABB
beloved , thou hast brought me many flowers
plucked in the garden , all the summer through
and winter , and it seemed as if they grew
in this close room , nor missed the sun and showers
ABBA
so , in the like name of that love of ours
take back these thoughts which here unfolded too
and which on warm and cold days i withdrew
from my heart 's ground . indeed , those beds and bowers
ABBA
be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue
and wait thy weeding ; yet here 's eglantine
here 's ivy !— take them , as i used to do
thy flowers , and keep them where they shall not pine
ABAB
and lest , by length of time , it be pretended
the climate may this modern breed have mended
wise providence , to keep us where we are
mixes us daily with exceeding care
AABB
we have been europe 's sink , the jakes , where she
voids all her offal out cast progeny
from our fifth henry 's time the strolling bands
of banish 'd fugitives from neighb'ring lands
AABB
the shivering wind sits in the oaks , whose limbs
twisted and tortured , nevermore are still
grief and decay sit with it ; they , whose chill
autumnal touch makes hectic red the rims
ABBA
of all the oak leaves ; desolating , dims
the ageratum 's blue that banks the rill
and splits the milkweed 's pod upon the hill
and shakes it free of the last seed that swims
ABBA
down goes the day despondent to its close
and now the sunset 's hands of copper build
a tower of brass , behind whose burning bars
the day , in fierce , barbarian repose
ABBA
and thou , my village ! as again i tread
amidst thy living and above thy dead
though some fair playmates guard with charter fears
their cheeks , grown holy with the lapse of years
AABB
though with the dust some reverend locks may blend
where life 's last mile stone marks the journey 's end
on every bud the changing year recalls
the brightening glance of morning memory falls
AABB
still following onward as the months unclose
the balmy lilac or the bridal rose
and still shall follow , till they sink once more
beneath the snow drifts of the frozen shore
AABB
feronde , a rich , but awkward , vulgar clown
a ninny was believed throughout the town
he had the charge of revenues not slight
which he collected for a friar white
AABB
of these i 've known as good as any black
when husbands some assistance seemed to lack
and had so much to do , they monks might need
or other friends , their work at home to speed
AABB
this friar for to morrow never thought
but squandered ev'ry thing as soon as brought
no saint apostle less of wealth retained
good cheer o'er ev'ry wish triumphant reigned
AABB
because a steadfast flame of clear intent
gave force and beauty to full actioned life
because his way was one of firm ascent
whose stepping stones were hewn of change and strife
ABAB
because as husband loveth noble wife
he loved fair truth ; because the thing he meant
to do , that thing he did , nor paused , nor bent
in face of poor and pale conclusions ; yea
ABBA
because of this , how fares the leader dead
what kind of mourners weep for him to day
what golden shroud is at his funeral spread
upon his brow what leaves of laurel , say
ABAB
three men lived yet when this dead man was young
whose names and words endure for ever : one
whose eyes grew dim with straining toward the sun
and his wings weakened , and his angel 's tongue
ABBA
lost half the sweetest song was ever sung
but like the strain half uttered earth hears none
nor shall man hear till all men 's songs are done
one whose clear spirit like an eagle hung
ABBA
between the mountains hallowed by his love
and the sky stainless as his soul above
and one the sweetest heart that ever spake
the brightest words wherein sweet wisdom smiled
AABB
what do we see ? is cato then become
a greater name in britain than in rome
does mankind now admire his virtues more
though lucan , horace , virgil , wrote before
AABB
how will posterity this truth explain
“ cato begins to live in anna ’ s reign
the world ’ s great chiefs , in council or in arms
rise in your lines with more exalted charms
AABB
illustrious deeds in distant nations wrought
and virtues by departed heroes taught
raise in your soul a pure immortal flame
adorn your life , and consecrate your fame
AABB
my god , my god , how much i love my goddess
whose virtues rare , unto the heavens arise
my god , my god , how much i love her eyes
one shining bright , the other full of hardness
ABBA
ah , woe is me for pleasure that is vain
ah , woe is me for glory that is past
pleasure that bringeth sorrow at the last
glory that at the last bringeth no gain
ABBA
so saith the sinking heart ; and so again
it shall say till the mighty angel blast
is blown , making the sun and moon aghast
and showering down the stars like sudden rain
ABBA
meanwhile , however , while thus the lady sought
by ev'ry charm to please , a note was brought
a page conveyed it , by the marquis sent
to say his coming business would prevent
AABB
the disappointment doubtless was severe
but consolation certainly was near
it proved to reynold wonderfully kind
for scarcely had our traveller resigned
AABB
and groaned aloud , but , tender as her dame
in haste the confidential servant came
and to the widow said :— i hear below
some poor unfortunate o'ercome with woe
AABB
i thank all who have loved me in their hearts
with thanks and love from mine . deep thanks to all
who paused a little near the prison wall
to hear my music in its louder parts
ABBA
ere they went onward , each one to the mart 's
or temple 's occupation , beyond call
but thou , who , in my voice 's sink and fall
when the sob took it , thy divinest art 's
ABBA
own instrument didst drop down at thy foot
to harken what i said between my tears
instruct me how to thank thee ! oh , to shoot
my soul 's full meaning into future years
ABAB
so long as ioves great bird did make his flight
bearing the fire with which heaven doth us fray
heaven had not feare of that presumptuous might
with which the giaunts did the gods assay
ABAB
but all so soone as scortching sunne had brent
his wings which wont the earth to overspredd
the earth out of her massie wombe forth sent
that antique horror which made heaven adredd
ABAB
then was the germane raven in disguise
that romane eagle seene to cleave asunder
and towards heaven freshly to arise
out of these mountaines , now consum 'd to pouder
ABAB
in wiser days , my darling rosebud , blown
to beauty proud as was your mother 's prime
in that desired , delayed , incredible time
you 'll ask why i abandoned you , my own
ABBA
and the dear heart that was your baby throne
to dice with death . and oh ! they 'll give you rhyme
and reason : some will call the thing sublime
and some decry it in a knowing tone
ABBA
so here , while the mad guns curse overhead
and tired men sigh with mud for couch and floor
know that we fools , now with the foolish dead
died not for flag , nor king , nor emperor
ABAB
when men shall find thy flower , thy glory pass
and thou with careful brow sitting alone
receiv è d hast this message from thy glass
that tells the truth , and says that all is gone
ABAB
fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou mad'st
though spent thy flame , in me the heat remaining
i that have loved thee thus before thou fad'st
my faith shall wax when thou art in thy waning
ABAB
the world shall find this miracle in me
that fire can burn when all the matter 's spent
then what my faith hath been thyself shalt see
and that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent
ABAB
oilean ajax first the voice obey ’ d
swift was his pace , and ready was his aid
next him idomeneus , more slow with age
and merion , burning with a hero ’ s rage
AABB
the long succeeding numbers who can name
but all were greeks , and eager all for fame
fierce to the charge great hector led the throng
whole troy embodied rush ’ d with shouts along
AABB
thus , when a mountain billow foams and raves
where some swoln river disembogues his waves
full in the mouth is stopp ’ d the rushing tide
the boiling ocean works from side to side
AABB
pensive within the coliseum 's walls
i stood with thee , o poet of the west
the day when each had been a welcome guest
in san clemente 's venerable halls
ABBA
with what delight my memory now recalls
that hour of hours , that flower of all the rest
when , with thy white beard falling on thy breast
that noble head , that well might serve as paul 's
ABBA
in some divinest vision of the saint
by raffael dreamed — i heard thee mourn the dead
the martyred host who fearless there , though faint
walked the rough road that up to heaven 's gate led
ABAB
i wage the combat with two mighty foes
which are more strong than i ten thousand fold
the one is when thy pleasure i do lose
the other , when thy person i behold
ABAB
in seeing thee a swarm of loves confound me
and cause my death in spite of my resist
and if i see thee not , thy want doth wound me
for in thy sight my comfort doth consist
ABAB
the one in me continual care createth
the other doth occasion my desire
the one the edge of all my joy rebateth
the other makes me a phoenix in love 's fire
ABAB
great soul , thou sittest with me in my room
uplifting me with thy vast , quiet eyes
on whose full orbs , with kindly lustre , lies
the twilight warmth of ruddy ember gloom
ABBA
thy clear , strong tones will oft bring sudden bloom
of hope secure , to him who lonely cries
wrestling with the young poet 's agonies
neglect and scorn , which seem a certain doom
ABBA
yes ! the few words which , like great thunder drops
thy large heart down to earth shook doubtfully
thrilled by the inward lightning of its might
serene and pure , like gushing joy of light
AABB
extension 's golden vantage ! the decree
each way exclusive , scorn , and re enthrone
the obsolete , if strength , or grace of tone
or imagery await it , with a free
ABBA
and liberal daring !— for the critic train
whose eyes severe our verbal stores review
let the firm bard require that they explain
their cause of censure ; then in balance true
ABAB
we mourn not for our martyrs !— for they perish
as the good perish , for a deathless faith
their glorious memories men will fondly cherish
in terms and signs that shall ennoble death
ABAB
their blood becomes a principle , to guide
onward , forever onward , in proud flow
restless , resistless , as the ocean tide
the spirit heaven yields freedom here below
ABAB
how should we mourn the martyrs , who arise
even from the stake and scaffold , to the skies
and take their thrones , as slars ; and o'er the night
shed a new glory ; and to other souls
AABB
a little garden on a bleak hillside
where deep the heavy , dazzling mountain snow
lies far into the spring . the sun 's pale glow
is scarcely able to melt patches wide
ABBA
about the single rose bush . all denied
of nature 's tender ministries . but no
for wonder working faith has made it blow
with flowers many hued and starry eyed
ABBA
here sleeps the sun long , idle summer hours
here butterflies and bees fare far to rove
amid the crumpled leaves of poppy flowers
here four o'clocks , to the passionate night above
ABAB
led by the dark dominicans of spain
a newborn fury walks the wide domain
gaunt inquisition ; mark her giant stride
her blood nursed vulture screaming at her side
AABB
her priestly train the tools of torment brings
racks , wheels and crosses , faggots , stakes and strings
scaffolds and cages round her altar stand
and , tipt with sulphur , waves her flaming brand
AABB
her imps of inquest round the fiend advance
suspectors grave , and spies with eye askance
pretended heretics who worm the soul
and sly confessors with their secret scroll
AABB
and as the coward beasts use to despise
the noble lion after his lives end
whetting their teeth , and with vaine foolhardise
daring the foe that cannot him defend
ABAB
“ great perils , father ! wait the unequal fight
these younger champions will oppress thy might
thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow
weak is thy servant , and thy coursers slow
AABB
then haste , ascend my seat , and from the car
observe the steeds of tros , renown ’ d in war
practised alike to turn , to stop , to chase
to dare the fight , or urge the rapid race
AABB
these late obey ’ d æ neas ’ guiding rein
leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train
with these against yon trojans will we go
nor shall great hector want an equal foe
AABB
the worldly prince doth in his sceptre hold
a kind of heaven in his authorities
the wealthy miser , in his mass of gold
makes to his soul a kind of paradise
ABAB
but , my sweet god , i seek no prince 's power
no miser 's wealth , nor beauty 's fading gloss
which pamper sin , whose sweets are inward sour
and sorry gains that breed the spirit 's loss
ABAB
take any station , pavement , circus , corner
where men their styles of print may call or choose
and there — ten times more on it than jack horner
there shall you find him swathed in sheets of news
ABAB
nothing can stay the placing of his wares
not bus , nor cab , nor dray ! the very slop
that imp of power , is powerless ! ever he dares
and , daring , lands his public neck and crop
ABAB
like as whilome the children of the earth
heapt hils on hils to scale the starrie skie
and fight against the gods of heavenly berth
whiles iove at them his thunderbolts let flie
ABAB
all suddenly with lightning overthrowne
the furious squadrons downe to ground did fall
that th'earth under her childrens weight did grone
and th'heavens in glorie triumpht over all
ABAB
be it not mine to steal the cultured flower
from any garden of the rich and great
nor seek with care , through many a weary hour
some novel form of wonder to create
ABAB
enough for me the leafy woods to rove
and gather simple cups of morning dew
or , in the fields and meadows that i love
find beauty in their bells of every hue
ABAB
thus round my cottage floats a fragrant air
and though the rustic plot be humbly laid
yet , like the lilies gladly growing there
i have not toiled , but take what god has made
ABAB
when winds that move not its calm surface sweep
the azure sea , i love the land no more
the smiles of the serene and tranquil deep
tempt my unquiet mind .— but when the roar
ABAB
of ocean 's gray abyss resounds , and foam
gathers upon the sea , and vast waves burst
i turn from the drear aspect to the home
of earth and its deep woods , where , interspersed
ABAB
dame fortune often loves a laugh to raise
and , playing off her tricks and roguish ways
instead of giving us what we desire
mere quid pro quo permits us to acquire
AABB
i 've found her gambols such from first to last
and judge the future by experience past
fair cloris and myself felt mutual flame
and , when a year had run , the sprightly dame
AABB
prepared to grant me , if i may be plain
some slight concessions that would ease my pain
this was her aim ; but whatsoe'er in view
‘ tis opportunity we should pursue
AABB
oh let us never leave that happy throng
from that low attitude of love not cease
in all the world there is no other peace
in all the world no other shield from wrong
ABBA
but chiefly , saviour , for thy feet we long
for no vain quiet , for no pride 's increase
but that , being weak , and thou divinely strong
us from our hateful selves thou mayst release
ABAB
we wander from thy fold 's free holy air
forget thy looks , and take our fill of sin
but if thou keep us evermore within
we never surely can forget thee there
ABBA
i cannot think that thou shouldst pass away
whose life to mine is an eternal law
a piece of nature that can have no flaw
a new and certain sunrise every day
ABBA
but , if thou art to be another ray
about the sun of life , and art to live
free from what part of thee was fugitive
the debt of love i will more fully pay
ABBA
not downcast with the thought of thee so high
but rather raised to be a nobler man
and more divine in my humanity
as knowing that the waiting eyes which scan
ABAB
lyre of the sonnet , that full many a time
amus 'd my lassitude , and sooth 'd my pains
when graver cares forbade the lengthen 'd strains
to thy brief bound , and oft returning chime
ABBA
a long farewell !— the splendid forms of rhyme
when grief in lonely orphanism reigns
oppress the drooping soul .— death 's dark domains
throw mournful shadows o'er the aonian clime
ABBA
for in their silent bourne my filial bands
lie all dissolv 'd ;— and swiftly wasting pour
from my frail glass of life , health 's sparkling sands
sleep then , my lyre , thy tuneful tasks are o'er
ABAB
the air of the valley has felt the chill
the workers pause at the door of the mill
the housewife , keen to the shivering air
arrests her foot on the cottage stair
AABB
instinctive taught by the mother love
and thinks of the sleeping ones above
why start the listeners ? why does the course
of the mill stream widen ? is it a horse
AABB
hark to the sound of his hoofs , they say
that gallops so wildly williamsburg way
god ! what was that , like a human shriek
from the winding valley ? will nobody speak
AABB
because i feel that , in the heavens above
the angels , whispering to one another
can find , among their burning terms of love
none so devotional as that of “ mother
ABAB
therefore by that dear name i long have called you
you who are more than mother unto me
and fill my heart of hearts , where death installed you
in setting my virginia 's spirit free
ABAB
my mother — my own mother , who died early
was but the mother of myself ; but you
are mother to the one i loved so dearly
and thus are dearer than the mother i knew
ABAB
needs must i leave and yet needs must i love
in vain my wit doth tell in verse my woe
despair in me , disdain in thee , doth show
how by my wit i do my folly prove
ABBA
all this my heart from love can never move
love is not in my heart . no , lady , no
my heart is love itself . till i forego
my heart i never can my love remove
ABBA
how can i then leave love ? i do intend
not to crave grace , but yet to wish it still
not to praise thee , but beauty to commend
and so , by beauty 's praise , praise thee i will
ABAB
why should false painting imitate his cheek
and steal dead seeming of his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow , since his rose is true
ABAB
why should he live , now nature bankrupt is
beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
for she hath no exchequer now but his
and proud of many , lives upon his gains
ABAB
homes of our sires , where learning 's temple rose
while vet they struggled with their banded foes
as in the west thy century 's sun descends
one parting gleam its dying radiance lends
AABB
darker and deeper though the shadows fall
from the gray towers on doubting castle 's wall
though pope and pagan re array their hosts
and her new armor youthful science boasts
AABB
truth , for whose altar rose this holy shrine
shall fly for refuge to these bowers of thine
no past shall chain her with its rusted vow
no jew 's phylactery bind her christian brow
AABB
thus prayed the sage : the eternal gave consent
and peals of thunder shook the firmament
presumptuous troy mistook the accepting sign
and catch ’ d new fury at the voice divine
AABB
as , when black tempests mix the seas and skies
the roaring deeps in watery mountains rise
above the sides of some tall ship ascend
its womb they deluge , and its ribs they rend
AABB
thus loudly roaring , and o ’ erpowering all
mount the thick trojans up the grecian wall
legions on legions from each side arise
thick sound the keels ; the storm of arrows flies
AABB
i would in rich and golden coloured rain
with tempting showers in pleasant sort descend
into fair phillis ’ lap , my lovely friend
when sleep her sense with slumber doth restrain
ABBA
i would be chang è d to a milk white bull
when midst the gladsome fields she should appear
by pleasant fineness to surprise my dear
whilst from their stalks , she pleasant flowers did pull
ABBA
i were content to weary out my pain
to be narsissus so she were a spring
to drown in her those woes my heart do wring
and more ; i wish transform è d to remain
ABBA
to gasperin 's so often went our wight
the wife at length became his sole delight
whose youth and beauty were by all confessed
but , ‘ midst these charms , such av'rice she possessed
AABB
the warmest love was checked — a thing not rare
in modern times at least , among the fair
‘ tis true , as i 've already said , with such
sighs naught avail , and promises not much
AABB
without a purse , who wishes should express
would vainly hope to gain a soft caress
the god of love no other charm employs
then cards , and dress , and pleasure 's cheering joys
AABB
vanity of vanities , the preacher saith
all things are vanity . the eye and ear
cannot be filled with what they see and hear
like early dew , or like the sudden breath
ABBA
of wind , or like the grass that withereth
is man , tossed to and fro by hope and fear
so little joy hath he , so little cheer
till all things end in the long dust of death
ABBA
to day is still the same as yesterday
to morrow also even as one of them
and there is nothing new under the sun
until the ancient race of time be run
AABB
there never yet was flower fair in vain
let classic poets rhyme it as they will
the seasons toil that it may blow again
and summer 's heart doth feel its every ill
ABAB
nor is a true soul ever born for naught
wherever any such hath lived and died
there hath been something for true freedom wrought
some bulwark levelled on the evil side
ABAB
toil on , then , greatness ! thou art in the right
however narrow souls may call thee wrong
be as thou wouldst be in thine own clear sight
and so thou shalt be in the world 's erelong
ABAB
fair art thou , phillis , ay , so fair , sweet maid
as nor the sun , nor i have seen more fair
for in thy cheeks sweet roses are embayed
and gold more pure than gold doth gild thy hair
ABAB
sweet bees have hived their honey on thy tongue
and hebe spiced her nectar with thy breath
about thy neck do all the graces throng
and lay such baits as might entangle death
ABAB
in such a breast what heart would not be thrall
from such sweet arms who would not wish embraces
at thy fair hands who wonders not at all
wonder itself through ignorance embases
ABAB
here from this summit where i often roam
i can behold my cot , my humble home
there i was born , and when this life is o'er
i hope to sleep upon the river 's shore
AABB
there is the orchard which i helped to rear
it well repays my labor year by year
one apple tree towers high above the rest
where every spring a blackbird has its nest
AABB
sweet lily used to stand beneath the bough
and smiling listen — but she comes not now
a fairer bird ne'er charmed the rising day
than she we loved thus early called away
AABB
for mahomet may dream of heavenly stews
where virgin rose , soon as it 's lost , renews
and shake with every breath of air serene
as trembling for the rapes they 've daily seen
AABB
when if those past can shake their height profound
ridotto sure will fell them to the ground
here art to nature join 'd makes it compleat
and pyramids and trees together meet
AABB
statues amidst the thickest grove arise
and lofty columns tow'ring to the skies
then next an obelisk its shade displays
and rustic rockwork fills each empty space
AABB
she said . with awe divine , the queen of love
obey ’ d the sister and the wife of jove
and from her fragrant breast the zone embraced
with various skill and high embroidery graced
AABB
in this was every art , and every charm
to win the wisest , and the coldest warm
fond love , the gentle vow , the gay desire
the kind deceit , the still reviving fire
AABB
persuasive speech , and the more persuasive sighs
silence that spoke , and eloquence of eyes
this on her hand the cyprian goddess laid
“ take this , and with it all thy wish ; ” she said
AABB
what though his feet were shod with sharp , fierce flame
and death and ruin were his daily squires
the scythian , helped by heaven 's thunders , came
the time was ripe for god 's avenging fires
ABAB
lo ! loose , lewd trulls , and lean , luxurious liars
had brought the fair , fine face of rome to shame
and made her one with sins beyond a name
that queenly daughter of imperial sires
ABBA
the blood of elders like the blood of sheep
was dashed across the circus . once while din
and dust and lightnings , and a draggled heap
of beast slain men made lords with laughter leap
AABB
the winds have grown articulate in thee
and voiced again the wail of ancient woe
that smote upon the winds of long ago
the cries of trojan women as they flee
ABBA
the quivering moan of pale andromache
now lifted loud with pain and now brought low
it is the soul of sorrow that we know
as in a shell the soul of all the sea
ABBA
so sometimes in the compass of a song
unknown to him who sings , thro ’ lips that live
the voiceless dead of long forgotten lands
proclaim to us their heaviness and wrong
ABBA
birds sing and build , and nature scorns alone
on may 's young festival to be a widow
the children , too , have pleasures all their own
in gathering lady smocks along the meadow
ABAB
the little brook sings loud among the pebbles
so very loud , that water flowers , which lie
where many a silver curdle boils and dribbles
dance too with joy as it goes singing by
ABAB
beloved , my beloved , when i think
that thou wast in the world a year ago
what time i sat alone here in the snow
and saw no footprint , heard the silence sink
ABBA
no moment at thy voice , but , link by link
went counting all my chains as if that so
they never could fall off at any blow
struck by thy possible hand ,— why , thus i drink
ABBA
of life 's great cup of wonder ! wonderful
never to feel thee thrill the day or night
with personal act or speech ,— nor ever cull
some prescience of thee with the blossoms white
ABAB
“ from these dire shores our rapid course we held
auspicious gales the flying canvas swell 'd
and joy 's faint sunshine kindled in my eyes
as the last mountain mingled with the skies
AABB
when , by conflicting winds together driven
a night of clouds involved the starless heaven
fierce and more fierce th ’ increasing tempest blew
the thunder rattled , and the lightning flew
AABB
soon , borne at random o'er the watery way
the yawning rocks our guideless ship betray
my shrieking comrades sink .— some power unseen
preserved me , trembling , thro ’ the deathful scene
AABB
while i gazed at that fair one 's cheek , a shade
of thought or care stole softly over
like that by a cloud in a summer 's day made
looking down on a field of blossoming clover
ABAB
the rose yet lay on her cheek , but its flush
had something lost of its brilliant blush
and the light in her eye , and the light on the wheels
that marched so calmly round above her
AABB
was a little dimmed ,— as when evening steals
upon noon 's hot face . yet one could n't but love her
for she looked like a mother whose first babe lay
rocked on her breast , as she swung all day
AABB
while i call god — call god !— so let thy mouth
be heir to those who are now exanimate
gather the north flowers to complete the south
and catch the early love up in the late
ABAB
calm is all nature as a resting wheel
the kine are couch 'd upon the dewy grass
the horse alone , seen dimly as i pass
is up , and cropping yet his later meal
ABBA
dark is the ground ; a slumber seems to steal
o'er vale , and mountain , and the starless sky
now , in this blank of things , a harmony
home felt , and home created seems to heal
ABBA
that grief for which the senses still supply
fresh food ; for only then , when memory
is hush 'd , am i at rest . my friends , restrain
those busy cares that would allay my pain
AABB
who shall invoke her , who shall be her priest
with single rites the common debt to pay
on some green headland fronting to the east
our fairest boy shall kneel at break of day
ABAB
naked , uplifting in a laden tray
new milk and honey and sweet tinctured wine
not without twigs of clustering apple spray
to wreath a garland for our lady 's shrine
ABAB
the morning planet poised above the sea
shall drop sweet influence through her drowsing lid
dew drenched , his delicate virginity
shall scarce disturb the flowers he kneels amid
ABAB
in sunday school engaged twice each lord 's day
and hearing three discourses , some would say
no time could then remain for aught beside
but this , my friends , has only to be tried
AABB
for cooper , in reserve , two hours still kept
an elder 's invitation to accept
him to accompany to his home , and there
join in sweet conversation , hymn or prayer
AABB
thus mostly passed his sabbaths for two years
which kept him free from many doubts and fears
enabled him to work at business still
with easy mind , and with right hearty will
AABB
sweet , i protest , and seal it with an oath
i never saw that so my thoughts did please
and yet content displeased i see them wroth
to love so much and cannot have their ease
ABAB
i told my thoughts , my sovereign made a pause
disposed to grant , but willing to delay
they then repined , for that they knew no cause
and swore they wished she flatly would say nay
ABAB
thus hath my love , my thoughts with treason filled
and ‘ gainst my sovereign taught them to repine
so thus my treason all my thoughts hath killed
and made fair licia say she is not mine
ABAB
scarce had the voices ceased , when forth there came
another candidate for village fame
by gratitude to heaven , by honest pride
impell 'd to rise and cast his doubts aside
AABB
a sturdy yeoman , button 'd to the throat
faced the whole ring , and shook his leathern coat
“ i have a tale of private life to tell
“ ‘ tis all of self and home , i know it well
AABB
“ in love and honour 's cause i would be strong
“ mine is a father 's tale , perhaps too long
“ for fathers , when a duteous child 's the theme
“ can talk a summer 's sun down , and then dream
AABB
the poetry of earth is never dead
when all the birds are faint with the hot sun
and hide in cooling trees , a voice will run
from hedge to hedge about the new mown mead
ABBA
that is the grasshopper 's — he takes the lead
in summer luxury ,— he has never done
with his delights ; for when tired out with fun
he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed
ABBA
the poetry of earth is ceasing never
on a lone winter evening , when the frost
has wrought a silence , from the stove there shrills
the cricket 's song , in warmth increasing ever
ABBA
much have i travelled in the realms of gold
and many goodly states and kingdoms seen
round many western islands have i been
which bards in fealty to apollo hold
ABBA
oft of one wide expanse had i been told
that deep browed homer ruled as his demesne
yet never did i breathe its pure serene
till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold
ABBA
then felt i like some watcher of the skies
when a new planet swims into his ken
or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes
he stared at the pacific — and all his men
ABAB
if there be any one can take my place
and make you happy whom i grieve to grieve
think not that i can grudge it , but believe
i do commend you to that nobler grace
ABBA
that readier wit than mine , that sweeter face
yea , since your riches make me rich , conceive
i too am crowned , while bridal crowns i weave
and thread the bridal dance with jocund pace
ABBA
for if i did not love you , it might be
that i should grudge you some one dear delight
but since the heart is yours that was mine own
your pleasure is my pleasure , right my right
ABAB
if light of life outlive the set of sun
that men call death and end of all things , then
how should not that which life held best for men
and proved most precious , though it seem undone
ABBA
by force of death and woful victory won
be first and surest of revival , when
death shall bow down to life arisen again
so shall the soul seen be the self same one
ABBA
the silent room , the heavy creeping shade
the dead that travel fast , the opening door
the murdered brother rising through the floor
the ghost 's white fingers on thy shoulders laid
ABBA
and then the lonely duel in the glade
the broken swords , the stifled scream , the gore
thy grand revengeful eyes when all is o'er
these things are well enough ,— but thou wert made
ABBA
for more august creation ! frenzied lear
should at thy bidding wander on the heath
with the shrill fool to mock him , romeo
for thee should lure his love , and desperate fear
ABBA
“ inglorious sons of an unhappy sire
why did not all in hector ’ s cause expire
wretch that i am ! my bravest offspring slain
you , the disgrace of priam ’ s house , remain
AABB
mestor the brave , renown ’ d in ranks of war
with troilus , dreadful on his rushing car
and last great hector , more than man divine
for sure he seem ’ d not of terrestrial line
AABB
all those relentless mars untimely slew
and left me these , a soft and servile crew
whose days the feast and wanton dance employ
gluttons and flatterers , the contempt of troy
AABB
and thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping
and dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing
and so never ending , but always descending
sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending
AABB
if e'er again return those awful days
whose clouds were crimsoned with the beacon 's blaze
whose grass was trampled by the soldier 's heel
whose tides were reddened round the rushing keel
AABB
god grant some lyre may wake a nobler strain
to rend the silence of our tented plain
when gallia 's flag its triple fold displays
her marshalled legions peal the marseillaise
AABB
when round the german close the war clouds dim
far through their shadows floats his battle hymn
when , crowned with joy , the camps ’ of england ring
a thousand voices shout , “ god save the king
AABB
already the rutulians deem their man
o'ermatch ' d in arms , before the fight began
first rising fears are whisper 'd thro ’ the crowd
then , gath'ring sound , they murmur more aloud
AABB
now , side to side , they measure with their eyes
the champions ’ bulk , their sinews , and their size
the nearer they approach , the more is known
th ’ apparent disadvantage of their own
AABB
turnus himself appears in public sight
conscious of fate , desponding of the fight
slowly he moves , and at his altar stands
with eyes dejected , and with trembling hands
AABB
let us forget . what matters it that we
once reigned o'er happy realms of long ago
and talked of love , and let our voices low
and ruled for some brief sessions royally
ABBA
what if we sung , or laughed , or wept maybe
it has availed not anything , and so
let it go by that we may better know
how poor a thing is lost to you and me
ABBA
but yesterday i kissed your lips , and yet
did thrill you not enough to shake the dew
from your drenched lids — and missed , with no regret
your kiss shot back , with sharp breaths failing you
ABAB
the hills are gleaming brass , and bronze the peaks
the mesas are a brazen , molten sea
and e'en the heaven 's blue infinity
undimmed by kindly cloud through arid weeks
ABBA
seems polished turquoise . like a sphinx she speaks
the scornful desert : “ what would'st thou from me
and in our hearts we answer her ; all three
unlike , for each a different treasure seeks
ABBA
one sought adventure , and the desert gave
his restless heart found rest beneath her sands
one sought but gold . he dug his soul a grave
the desert 's gift worked evil in his hands
ABAB
when death , or adverse fortune 's ruthless gale
tears our best hopes away , the wounded heart
exhausted , leans on all that can impart
the charm of sympathy ; her mutual wail
ABBA
how soothing ! never can her warm tears fail
to balm our bleeding grief 's severest smart
nor wholly vain feign 'd pity 's solemn art
tho ’ we should penetrate her sable veil
ABBA
and thou , o river of to morrow , flowing
between thy narrow adamantine walls
but beautiful , and white with waterfalls
and wreaths of mist , like hands the pathway showing
ABBA
i hear the trumpets of the morning blowing
i hear thy mighty voice , that calls and calls
and see , as ossian saw in morven 's halls
mysterious phantoms , coming , beckoning , going
ABBA
it is the mystery of the unknown
that fascinates us ; we are children still
wayward and wistful ; with one hand we cling
to the familiar things we call our own
ABBA
my frail and earthly bark , by reason 's guide
which holds the helm , whilst will doth wield the sail
by my desires , the winds of bad betide
hath sailed these worldly seas with small avail
ABAB
and views my course , and sees the winds aspire
bids reason watch to scape the shoals of love
but lawless will enflamed with endless ire
doth steer empoop , [ b ] whilst reason doth retire
AABB
she back four paces drew , at first , through shame
then , led by love , eight others forward came
but scruples still arose that ardour foiled
and nearly ey'ry thing had truly spoiled
AABB
anne had a conscience pure as holy fire
but how could she abstain from soft desire
if , in the bosom chance a flame should raise
is there a pow'r can then subdue the blaze
AABB
at first these inclinations she withstood
but doubting soon , how those of flesh and blood
could sins commit by stepping in advance
she took her seat upon the green expanse
AABB
so shall i live , supposing thou art true
like a deceived husband , so love 's face
may still seem love to me , though altered new
thy looks with me , thy heart in other place
ABAB
for there can live no hatred in thine eye
therefore in that i cannot know thy change
in many 's looks , the false heart 's history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
ABAB
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whate'er thy thoughts , or thy heart 's workings be
thy looks should nothing thence , but sweetness tell
ABAB
lift up your eyes ! behold these pictured walls
look where the flood of western glory falls
through the great sunflower disk of blazing panes
in ruby , saffron , azure , emerald stains
AABB
with reverent step the marble pavement tread
where our proud mother 's martyr roll is read
see the great halls that cluster , gathering round
this lofty shrine with holiest memories crowned
AABB
see the fair matron in her summer bower
fresh as a rose in bright perennial flower
read on her standard , always in the van
“ truth , ” — the one word that makes a slave a man
AABB
because i oft in dark abstracted guise
seem most alone in greatest company
with dearth of words , or answers quite awry
to them that would make speech of speech arise
ABBA
they deem , and of their doom the rumour flies
that poison foul of bubbling pride doth lie
so in my swelling breast , that only i
fawn on myself , and others do despise
ABBA
yet pride , i think , doth not my soul possess
which looks too oft in his unflattering glass
but one worse fault , ambition , i confess
that makes me oft my best friends overpass
ABAB
some men i have beheld with wonderment
noble in form and feature , god 's design
in whom the thought must search , as in a mine
for that live soul of theirs , by which they went
ABBA
thus walking on the earth . and i have bent
frequent regard on women , who gave sign
that god willed beauty , when he drew the line
that shaped each float and fold of beauty 's tent
ABBA
but the soul , drawing up in little space
thus left the form all staring , self dismayed
a vacant sign of what might be the grace
if mind swelled up , and filled the plan displayed
ABAB
him , in his march , the wounded princes meet
by tardy steps ascending from the fleet
the king of men , ulysses the divine
and who to tydeus owes his noble line
AABB
( their ships at distance from the battle stand
in lines advanced along the shelving strand
whose bay , the fleet unable to contain
at length ; beside the margin of the main
AABB
rank above rank , the crowded ships they moor
who landed first , lay highest on the shore
supported on the spears , they took their way
unfit to fight , but anxious for the day
AABB
the hostess whispered him she thought her spouse
again , my dear , such sparks let 's never house
pray do n't you hear how they together chat
just then the husband raised himself and sat
AABB
is this your plan ? said he with mighty rage
was it for this you would my house engage
you understand me , but i 'll seek redress
think you so very cheap to have success
AABB
what , would you ruin families at will
and with our daughters take at ease your fill
away , i say ! my house this moment quit
and as for you , abominable chit
AABB
through armes and vassals rome the world subdu 'd
that one would weene that one sole cities strength
both land and sea in roundnes had survew 'd
to be the measure of her bredth and length
ABAB
dost think that time , to whom stars vainly sue
will for thy beauty keep one fix è d place
or that he may , o'erhyppphenweighed with seasons due
forget one spring where veinlet tendrils lace
ABAB
rose over rose to make this flower , thy face
look round thee now , dear dupe of sweet hey day
of what once blooming joy canst thou find trace
save in the bosom of a cold decay
ABAB
what violet of summer 's yester sway
usurps these clouds to throne her slender moon
look on the wrinkling year , the shrunken way
the wintry bier of all that gaudy shone
ABAB
lady , thou weepest for the maniac 's woe
and thou art fair , and thou , like me , art young
oh ! may thy bosom never , never know
the pangs with which my wretched heart is wrung
ABAB
i had a mother once — a brother too
( beneath yon yew my father rests his head
i had a lover once , and kind and true
but mother , brother , lover , all are fled
ABAB
yet , whence the tear which dims thy lovely eye
oh ! gentle lady — not for me thus weep
the green sod soon upon my breast will lie
and soft and sound will be my peaceful sleep
ABAB
so in cheapside , what time aurora peeps
a mingled noise of dustmen , milk , and sweeps
falls on the housemaid 's ear : amazed she stands
then opes the door with cinder sabled hands
AABB
and “ matches ” calls . the dustman , bubbled flat
thinks ‘ tis for him and doffs his fan tail 'd hat
the milkman , whom her second cries assail
with sudden sink unyokes the clinking pail
AABB
now louder grown , by turns she screams and weeps
alas ! her screaming only brings the sweeps
sweeps but put out — she wants to raise a flame
and calls for matches , but ‘ tis still the same
AABB
i must not grieve , my love , whose eyes would read
lines of delight , whereon her youth might smile
flowers have time before they come to seed
and she is young , and now must sport the while
ABAB
and sport , sweet maid , in season of these years
and learn to gather flowers before they wither
and where the sweetest blossom first appears
let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither
ABAB
lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air
and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise
pity and smiles do best become the fair
pity and smiles must only yield thee praise
ABAB
the soft west wind , returning , brings again
its lovely family of herbs and flowers
progne 's gay notes and philomela 's strain
vary the dance of springtide 's rosy hours
ABAB
and joyously o'er every field and plain
glows the bright smile that greets them from above
and the warm spirit of reviving love
breathes in the air and murmurs from the main
ABBA
but tears and sorrowing sighs , which gushingly
pour from the secret chambers of my heart
are all that spring returning brings to me
and in the modest smile , or glance of art
ABAB
shall we , too , rise forgetful from our sleep
and shall my soul that lies within your hand
remember nothing , as the blowing sand
forgets the palm where long blue shadows creep
ABBA
when winds along the darkened desert sweep
or would it still remember , tho ’ it spanned
a thousand heavens , while the planets fanned
the vacant ether with their voices deep
ABBA
soul of my soul , no word shall be forgot
nor yet alone , beloved , shall we see
the desolation of extinguished suns
nor fear the void wherethro ’ our planet runs
AABB
youth gone , and beauty gone if ever there
dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this
youth gone and beauty , what remains of bliss
i will not bind fresh roses in my hair
ABBA
to shame a cheek at best but little fair
leave youth his roses , who can bear a thorn
i will not seek for blossoms anywhere
except such common flowers as blow with corn
ABAB
youth gone and beauty gone , what doth remain
the longing of a heart pent up forlorn
a silent heart whose silence loves and longs
the silence of a heart which sang its songs
AABB
what wrongs the oppressor suffered , these we know
these have found piteous voice in song and prose
but for the oppressed , their darkness and their woe
their grinding centuries ,— what muse had those
ABAB
though hall and palace had nor eyes nor ears
hardening a people 's heart to senseless stone
thou knewest them , o earth , that drank their tears
o heaven , that heard their inarticulate moan
ABAB
they noted down their fetters , link by link
coarse was the hand that scrawled , and red the ink
rude was their score , as suits unlettered men
notched with a headsman 's axe upon a block
AABB
thou know'st how guiltless first i met thy flame
when love approach 'd me under friendship 's name
my fancy form 'd thee of angelic kind
some emanation of the all beauteous mind
AABB
those smiling eyes , attempering every ray
shone sweetly lambent with celestial day
guiltless i gazed ; heaven listen 'd while you sung
and truths divine came mended from that tongue
AABB
from lips like those , what precept fail 'd to move
too soon they taught me ‘ twas no sin to love
back through the paths of pleasing sense i ran
nor wish 'd an angel whom i loved a man
AABB
flower of the desert , type mysterious , strange
like bird or monster on some sculptured tomb
in egypt 's curious fashion wrought , what change
or odd similitude of fate , what range
AABB
of cycling centuries from out the gloom
of dusty ages has evolved thy bloom
in the bleak desert of an alien zone
child of the past , why dwellest thou alone
AABB
grotesque , incongruous , amid the flowers
unlovely and unloved , standing aside
like to some rugged spirit sheathed in pride
unsmiling to the sun , untouched by showers
ABBA
‘ and then i came to seek thee in this cell
to crucify my worldliness and pride
to lay my heart 's affections all aside
as carnal hindrances which held my soul
ABBA
to wander always in a feverish dream
on plains where there is only sun and sand
no rock or tree in all the weary land
my thirst unquenchable , my heart burnt dry
ABBA
this medieval knight ( the legend saith
for months would scarcely draw a sober breath
but as his appetite grew more and more
drank each day worse than on the day before
AABB
was drunk all night , all day continued so
indulged in every vice he chanced to know
but long debauch and riotous excess
reduce their strongest votaries to distress
AABB
when nature can the strain no longer stand
she chastens with a sure and irate hand
so when the day of reckoning had come
she smote with fever and delirium
AABB
but passion ambushed by the aerial shrine
comes forth to dance , a hoofed obscenity
his satyr 's dance , with laughter in his eye
and cruelty along the scarlet line
ABBA
of his bright smiling mouth . all uncontrolled
love 's rebel servant , he delights to beat
the maddening quick dry rhythm of goatish feet
even in the sanctuary , and makes bold
ABBA
to mime himself the godhead of the place
he turns in terror from her trance calmed face
from the white lidded languor of her eyes
from lips that passion never shook before
AABB
a woman 's face with nature 's own hand painted
hast thou the master mistress of my passion
a woman 's gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false women 's fashion
ABAB
an eye more bright than theirs , less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
which steals men 's eyes and women 's souls amazeth
ABAB
three sang of love together : one with lips
crimson , with cheeks and bosom in a glow
flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips
and one there sang who soft and smooth as snow
ABAB
bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show
and one was blue with famine after love
who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low
the burden of what those were singing of
ABAB
one shamed herself in love ; one temperately
grew gross in soulless love , a sluggish wife
one famished died for love . thus two of three
took death for love and won him after strife
ABAB
while yet he spoke , impatient of delay
he braced his sandals on , and strode away
then from the heavens the martial goddess flies
through the wild fields of air , and cleaves the skies
AABB
in form , a virgin in soft beauty 's bloom
skill 'd in the illustrious labours of the loom
alone to ithaca she stood display 'd
but unapparent as a viewless shade
AABB
escaped telemachus ( the powers above
seen or unseen , o'er earth at pleasure move
the dogs intelligent confess 'd the tread
of power divine , and howling , trembling , fled
AABB
swept , clean , and still , across the polished floor
from some unshuttered casement , hid from sight
the level sunshine slants , its greater light
quenching the little lamp which pallid , poor
ABBA
flickering , unreplenished , at the door
has striven against darkness the long night
dawn fills the room , and penetrating , bright
the silent sunbeams through the window pour
ABBA
new yeare , forth looking out of ianus gate
doth seeme to promise hope of new delight
and , bidding th'old adieu , his passed date
bids all old thoughts to die in dumpish * spright
ABAB
and calling forth out of sad winters night
fresh love , that long hath slept in cheerlesse bower
wils him awake , and soone about him dight
his wanton wings and darts of deadly power
ABAB
for lusty spring now in his timely howre
is ready to come forth , him to receive
and warns the earth with divers colord flowre
to decke hir selfe , and her faire mantle weave
ABAB
once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee
and was the safeguard of the west : the worth
of venice did not fall below her birth
venice , the eldest child of liberty
ABBA
she was a maiden city , bright and free
no guile seduced , no force could violate
and , when she took unto herself a mate
she must espouse the everlasting sea
ABBA
and what if she had seen those glories fade
those titles vanish , and that strength decay
yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
when her long life hath reached its final day
ABAB
‘ of man and womman seen we wel also
that nedeth , in oon of thise termes two
this is to seyn , in youthe or elles age
he moot ben deed , the king as shal a page
AABB
what maketh this but iupiter the king
the which is prince and cause of alle thing
converting al un to his propre welle
from which it is deryved , sooth to telle
AABB
thou on whose stream , ‘ mid the steep sky 's commotion
loose clouds like earth 's decaying leaves are shed
shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean
angels of rain and lightning ; there are spread
ABAB
on the blue surface of thine airy surge
like the bright hair uplifted from the head
of some fierce maenad , ev'n from the dim verge
of the horizon to the zenith 's height
ABAB
the locks of the approaching storm . thou dirge
of the dying year , to which this closing night
will be the dome of a vast sepulchre
vaulted with all thy congregated might
ABAB
fill me once more the foaming pewter up
another board of oysters , ladye mine
to night lucullus with himself shall sup
these mute inglorious miltons are divine
ABAB
and as i here in slippered ease recline
quaffing of perkins ’ entire my fill
i sigh not for the lymph of aganippe 's rill
a nobler inspiration fires my brain
ABBA
caught from old england 's fine time hallowed drink
i snatch the pot again and yet again
and as the foaming fluids shrink and shrink
fill me once more , i say , up to the brink
AABB
nature made every fop to plague his brother
just as one beauty mortifies another
but here 's the captain that will plague them both
whose air cries , arm ! whose very look 's an oath
AABB
the captain 's honest , sirs , and that 's enough
though his soul 's bullet , and his body buff
he spits fore right ; his haughty chest before
like battering rams , beats open every door
AABB
and with a face as red , and as awry
as herod 's hangdogs in old tapestry
scarecrow to boys , the breeding woman 's curse
has yet a strange ambition to look worse
AABB
the doors are all wide open ; at the gate
the blossomed lilacs counterfeit a blaze
and seem to warm the air ; a dreamy haze
hangs o'er the brighton meadows like a fate
ABBA
and on their margin , with sea tides elate
the flooded charles , as in the happier days
writes the last letter of his name , and stays
his restless steps , as if compelled to wait
ABBA
i also wait ; but they will come no more
those friends of mine , whose presence satisfied
the thirst and hunger of my heart . ah me
they have forgotten the pathway to my door
ABBA
at ephesus , in former times , once shone
a fair , whose charms would dignify a throne
and , if to publick rumour credit ‘ s due
celestial bliss her husband with her knew
AABB
naught else was talked of but her beauteous face
and chastity that adds the highest grace
from ev'ry quarter numbers flocked to see
this belle , regarded as from errors free
AABB
the honour of her sex , and country too
as such , old mothers held her up to view
and wished their offspring 's wives like her to act
the sons desired the very same in fact
AABB
poet and poem one indivisible fact
because thou didst thine own ideal act
and so , for parchment , on the human soul
didst write thine aspirations — at thy goal
AABB
lo ! the year 's final day !— nature performs
its obsequies with darkness , wind , and rain
but man is jocund .— hark ! th ’ exultant strain
from towers and steeples drowns the wintry storms
ABBA
no village spire but to the cots and farms
right merrily , its scant and tuneless peal
rings round !— ah ! joy ungrateful !— mirth insane
wherefore the senseless triumph , ye , who feel
ABAB
this annual portion of brief life the while
depart for ever ?— brought it no dear hours
of health and night rest ?— none that saw the smile
on lips belov 'd ?— o ! with as gentle powers
ABAB
then the soul of the leper stood , up in his eyes
and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he
remembered in what a haughtier guise
he had flung an alms to leprosie
ABAB
when he girt his young life up in gilded mail
and set forth in search of the holy grail
the heart within him was ashes and dust
he parted in twain his single crust
AABB
he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink
and gave the leper to eat and drink
‘ t was a moldy crust of coarse brown bread
‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl
AABB
be still . the hanging gardens were a dream
that over persian roses flew to kiss
the curled lashes of semiramis
troy never was , nor green skamander stream
ABBA
provence and troubadour are merest lies
the glorious hair of venice was a beam
made within titian 's eye . the sunsets seem
the world is very old and nothing is
ABBA
be still . thou foolish thing , thou canst not wake
nor thy tears wedge thy soldered lids apart
but patter in the darkness of thy heart
thy brain is plagued . thou art a frighted owl
ABBA
no servile tenets would admittance find
destructive of the rights of humankind
of power divine , hereditary right
and non resistance to a tyrant 's might
AABB
for sure that all should thus for one be cursed
is but great nature 's edict just reversed
no moralists then , righteous to excess
would show fair virtue in so black a dress
AABB
that they , like boys , who some feigned sprite array
first from the spectre fly themselves away
no preachers in the terrible delight
but choose to win by reason , not affright
AABB
upon my word , replied another fair
if he were mine , i openly declare
to judge from what so pleasantly you say
i 'd make a present of him new year 's day
AABB
for pleasure never gives me full delight
unless a little pain the bliss invite
no doubt your husband moves as he is led
thank heav'n a different mortal claims my bed
AABB
to take him in , great nicety we need
but howsoe'er , at times i can succeed
the satisfaction doubly then is felt
in fond emotion bosoms freely melt
AABB
but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify your self in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
ABAB
now stand you on the top of happy hours
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
much liker than your painted counterfeit
ABAB
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this ( time 's pencil ) or my pupil pen
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live your self in eyes of men
ABAB
bride of the shark , her valour first i sing
who on the lone seas quickened of a king
she , from the shore and puny homes of men
beyond the climber ’ s sea discerning ken
AABB
swam , led by omens ; and devoid of fear
beheld her monstrous paramour draw near
she gazed ; all round her to the heavenly pale
the simple sea was void of isle or sail
AABB
sole overhead the unsparing sun was reared
when the deep bubbled and the brute appeared
but she , secure in the decrees of fate
made strong her bosom and received the mate
AABB
now on a bier the persian warriors place
the breathless youth , and shade his pallid face
and turning from that fatal field away
move towards the champion 's home in long array
AABB
then rustem , sick of martial pomp and show
himself the spring of all this scene of woe
doomed to the flames the pageantry he loved
shield , spear , and mace , so oft in battle proved
AABB
now lost to all , encompassed by despair
his bright pavilion crackling blazed in air
the sparkling throne the ascending column fed
in smoking fragments fell the golden bed
AABB
how darkly o'er yon far off mountain frowns
the gather 'd tempest ! from that lurid cloud
the deep voiced thunders roll , aweful and loud
tho ’ distant ; while upon the misty downs
ABBA
fast falls in shadowy streaks the pelting rain
i never saw so terrible a storm
perhaps some way worn traveller in vain
wraps his torn raiment round his shivering form
ABAB
cold even as hope within him ! i the while
pause me in sadness tho ’ the sunbeams smile
cheerily round me . ah that thus my lot
might be with peace and solitude assign 'd
AABB
“ shall then no more , o sire of gods ! be mine
the rights and honours of a power divine
scorn 'd e'en by man , and ( oh severe disgrace
by soft phaeacians , my degenerate race
AABB
against yon destined head in vain i swore
and menaced vengeance , ere he reach 'd his shore
to reach his natal shore was thy decree
mild i obey 'd , for who shall war with thee
AABB
behold him landed , careless and asleep
from all the eluded dangers of the deep
lo where he lies , amidst a shining store
of brass , rich garments , and refulgent ore
AABB
“ great is the profit ( thus the god rejoin ’ d
when ministers are blest with prudent mind
warn ’ d by thy words , to powerful jove i yield
and quit , though angry , the contended field
AABB
not but his threats with justice i disclaim
the same our honours , and our birth the same
if yet , forgetful of his promise given
to hermes , pallas , and the queen of heaven
AABB
to favour ilion , that perfidious place
he breaks his faith with half the ethereal race
give him to know , unless the grecian train
lay yon proud structures level with the plain
AABB
if nature 's voices have spoken to thee
with her holy meanings eloquently
if every creature hath won thy love
from the creeping worm to the brooding dove
AABB
if never a sad , low spoken word
hath pled with thy human heart unheard
then `, when the night steals on , as now
it will bring relief to thine aching brow
AABB
but to pursue my tale ; to welcome home
his warlike brother is pirithous come
arcite of thebes was known in arms long since
and honour 'd by this young thessalian prince
AABB
theseus , to gratify his friend and guest
who made our arcite 's freedom his request
restored to liberty the captive knight
but on these hard conditions i recite
AABB
that if hereafter arcite should be found
within the compass of athenian ground
by day or night , or on whate'er pretence
his head should pay the forfeit of the offence
AABB
all nature seems at work . slugs leave their lair
the bees are stirring — birds are on the wing
and winter , slumbering in the open air
wears on his smiling face a dream of spring
ABAB
and i the while , the sole unbusy thing
nor honey make , nor pair , nor build , nor sing
yet well i ken the banks where amaranths blow
have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow
AABB
bloom , o ye amaranths ! bloom for whom ye may
for me ye bloom not ! glide , rich streams , away
with lips unbrightened , wreathless brow , i stroll
and would you learn the spells that drowse my soul
AABB
he said : then from the bank his javelin tore
and left the breathless warrior in his gore
the floating tides the bloody carcase lave
and beat against it , wave succeeding wave
AABB
till , roll ’ d between the banks , it lies the food
of curling eels , and fishes of the flood
all scatter ’ d round the stream ( their mightiest slain
the amazed paeonians scour along the plain
AABB
he vents his fury on the flying crew
thrasius , astyplus , and mnesus slew
mydon , thersilochus , with æ nius , fell
and numbers more his lance had plunged to hell
AABB
give period to my matter of complaining
fair wonder of our time 's admiring eye
and entertain no more thy long disdaining
or give me leave at last that i may die
ABAB
for who can live , perpetually secluded
from death to life , that loathes her discontent
lest by some hope seducively deluded
such thoughts aspire to fortunate event
ABAB
but i that now have drawn mal pleasant breath
under the burden of thy cruel hate
o , i must long and linger after death
and yet i dare not give my life her date
ABAB
this bronze doth keep the very form and mold
of our great martyr 's face . yes , this is he
that brow all wisdom , all benignity
that human , humorous mouth ; those cheeks that hold
ABBA
like some harsh landscape all the summer 's gold
that spirit fit for sorrow , as the sea
for storms to beat on ; the lone agony
those silent , patient lips too well foretold
ABBA
yes , this is he who ruled a world of men
as might some prophet of the elder day
brooding above the tempest and the fray
with deep eyed thought and more than mortal ken
ABBA
the dede sleep , for wery bisinesse
fil on this carpenter right , as i gesse
aboute corfew tyme , or litel more
for travail of his goost he groneth sore
AABB
in former days , just by cythera town
a monastery was , of some renown
with nuns the queens of beauty filled the place
and gay gallants you easily might trace
AABB
the courtier , citizen , and parson too
the doctor and the bachelor you 'd view
with eager steps :— all visits thither made
and ‘ mong the latter , one ( a pleasing blade
AABB
had free access : was thought a prudent friend
who might to sisters many comforts lend
was always closely shaved and nicely dressed
and ev'ry thing he said was well expressed
AABB
the increasing moonlight drifts across my bed
and on the churchyard by the road , i know
it falls as white and noiselessly as snow
‘ twas such a night two weary summers fled
ABBA
the stars , as now , were waning overhead
listen ! again the shrill lipped bugles blow
where the swift currents of the river flow
past fredericksburg : far off the heavens are red
ABBA
with sudden conflagration : on yon height
linstock in hand , the gunners hold their breath
a signal rocket pierces the dense night
flings its spent stars upon the town beneath
ABAB
lord , thou thyself art love and only thou
yet i who am not love would fain love thee
but thou alone being love canst furnish me
with that same love my heart is craving now
ABBA
allow my plea ! for if thou disallow
no second fountain can i find but thee
no second hope or help is left to me
no second anything , but only thou
ABBA
o love accept , according my request
o love exhaust , fulfilling my desire
uphold me with the strength that cannot tire
nerve me to labor till thou bid me rest
ABBA
“ to ride a stick , to build a paper house
play odd and even , harness mouse and mouse
if a grown man professed to find delight
in things like these , you 'd call him mad outright
AABB
“ well now , should reason force you to admit
that love is just as childish , every whit
to own that whimpering at your mistress ’ door
is e'en as weak as building on the floor
AABB
say , will you put conviction into act
and , like young polemo , at once retract
take off the signs and trappings of disease
your leg bands , tippets , furs , and muffatees
AABB
can you , joconde , so truly cruel prove
to quit my fervent love in courts to move
the promises of kings are airy dreams
and scarcely last beyond the day 's extremes
AABB
by watchful , anxious care alone retain 'd
and lost , through mere caprice , as soon as gain 'd
if weary of my charms , alas ! you feel
still think , my love , what joys these woods conceal
AABB
here dwell around tranquillity and ease
the streams ’ soft murmurs , and the balmy breeze
invite to sleep ; these vales where breathe the doves
all , all , my dear joconde , renew our loves
AABB
‘ twas silence all . at last aegyptius spoke
aegyptius , by his age and sorrow broke
a length of days his soul with prudence crown 'd
a length of days had bent him to the ground
AABB
his eldest hope in arms to ilion came
by great ulysses taught the path to fame
but ( hapless youth ) the hideous cyclops tore
his quivering limbs , and quaff 'd his spouting gore
AABB
three sons remain 'd ; to climb with haughty fires
the royal bed , eurynomus aspires
the rest with duteous love his griefs assuage
and ease the sire of half the cares of age
AABB
hear how my sighs are echoed of the wind
see how my tears are pitied by the rain
feel what a flame possess è d hath my mind
taste but the grief which i possess in vain
ABAB
then if my sighs the blustering winds surpass
and wat'ry tears the drops of rain exceed
and if no flame like mine nor is nor was
nor grief like that whereon my soul doth feed
ABAB
relent , fair licia , when my sighs do blow
yield at my tears , that flintlike drops consume
accept the flame that doth my incense show
allow the grief that is my heart 's perfume
ABAB
though of the jews she merit most esteem
yet here the christian has the greater theme
her martial song describes how sis'ra fell
this sings our triumph over death and hell
AABB
the rising light employ 'd the sacred breath
of the blest virgin and elizabeth
in songs of joy the angels sung his birth
here how he treated was upon the earth
AABB
trembling we read ! th'affliction and the scorn
which for our guilt so patiently was borne
conception , birth , and suff'ring , all belong
( though various parts ) to one celestial song
AABB
love was laid down , all weary fast asleep
whereas my love his armor took away
the boy awaked , and straight began to weep
but stood amazed , and knew not what to say
ABAB
“ weep not , my boy , ” said venus to her son
“ thy weapons none can wield , but thou alone
licia the fair , this harm to thee hath done
i saw her here , and presently was gone
ABAB
she will restore them , for she hath no need
to take thy weapons where thy valour lies
for men to wound the fates have her decreed
with favour , hands , with beauty , and with eyes
ABAB
the little man with the vague beard and guise
pulled at the wicket . “ come inside ! ” he said
“ i 'll show you all we 've got now — it was size
you wanted ? — oh , dry colors ! well ” — he led
ABAB
to a dim alley lined with musty bins
and pulled one fiercely . violent and bold
a sudden tempest of mad , shrieking sins
scarlet screamed out above the battered gold
ABAB
of tins and picture frames . i held my breath
he tugged another hard — and sapphire skies
spread in vast quietude , serene as death
o'er waves like crackled turquoise — and my eyes
ABAB
i traverse oft in thought the battle plain
of my past life , ‘ mid many a shatter 'd dream
of pleasure , and of hope , which youth in vain
based on the shifting sands of time 's swift stream
ABAB
where both life 's pleasures and its cares began
earth crumbles ‘ neath our feet as we walk on
and leaves a gulf behind none can retrace
its pleasures flash a moment and are gone
ABAB
so take these kindly , even though there be
some notes that unto other lyres belong
stray echoes from the elder sons of song
and think how from its neighbouring native sea
ABBA
the pensive shell doth borrow melody
i would not do the lordly masters wrong
by filching fair words from the shining throng
whose music haunts me as the wind a tree
ABBA
beyond the low marsh meadows and the beach
seen through the hoary trunks of windy pines
the long blue level of the ocean shines
the distant surf , with hoarse , complaining speech
ABBA
out from its sandy barrier seems to reach
and while the sun behind the woods declines
the moaning sea with sighing boughs combines
and waves and pines make answer , each to each
ABBA
like this , is ours ; this night we ventur 'd out
on juv'nile wing , appall 'd by many a doubt
cheer 'd by your sanction , every peril o'er
with joy we hail this welcome , friendly shore
AABB
our little band , ambitious now to raise
a pleasing off'ring for your wreath of praise
on them bestow 'd , depute me here to tell
the lively feelings that their bosoms swell
AABB
for your indulgent and parental part
they feel the triumph of a grateful heart
that , each revolving year shall truly prove
how much they honor , how sincere they love
AABB
from room to quiet room , from wall to wall
breathing deliberately the very air
pressing our hands and nerves against warm darkness
to learn what ghosts are there
ABAB
if cross 'd with all mishaps be my poor life
if one short day i never spent in mirth
if my sp'rit with itself holds lasting strife
if sorrow 's death is but new sorrow 's birth
ABAB
if this vain world be but a mournful stage
where slave born man plays to the scoffing stars
if youth be toss 'd with love , with weakness age
if knowledge serves to hold our thoughts in wars
ABAB
if time can close the hundred mouths of fame
and make what 's long since past , like that 's to be
if virtue only be an idle name
if being born i was but born to die
ABAB
when i was still a boy and mother 's pride
a bigger boy spoke up to me so kind like
‘ if you do like , i 'll treat you with a ride
in this wheel barrow . ’ so then i was blind like
ABAB
to what he had a working in his mind like
and mounted for a passenger inside
and coming to a puddle , pretty wide
he tipp 'd me in a grinning back behind like
ABBA
while nature broods o'er the soft repose
of the dewy mead , and the half shut rose
does not that lovely hour give birth
to thoughts more allied to heaven than earth
AABB
when things that have been in perspective pass
like the sun 's last rays over memory 's glass
when life 's cares are forgot , when its joys are our own
and the mild beams of faith round the future are thrown
AABB
when all that awakened remorse or regret
like a stormy morn , has in splendour set
when the sorrows of time and the hopes of heaven
blend in the soul like the hues of even
AABB
this congreve follows in his deathless line
and the tenth hand is put to the design
the happy boldness of his finish 'd toil
claims more than shakespear 's wit , or johnson 's oil
AABB
sing on , harmonious swan , in weeping strains
and tell pastora 's death to mournful swains
or with more pleasing charms , with softer airs
sweeten our passions , and delude our cares
AABB
or let thy satyr grin with half a smile
and jeer in easy etherege 's style
let manly wycherly chalk out the way
and art direct , where nature goes astray
AABB
and yet i fear lest men who read these lines
should judge of them as if they wholly spake
the love i bear thee and thy holy sake
saying : “ he doth the high name wrong who twines
ABBA
earth 's highest aim with him , and thus combines
jesus and art . ” but i my refuge make
in what the word said : “ man his life shall take
from every word : ” in art god first designs
ABBA
he spoke the word . and let me humbly speak
my faith , that art is nothing to the act
lowliest , that to the truth bears witness meek
renownless , even unknown , but yet a fact
ABAB
in plays like these i would not deal alone
in words and phrases trite and too well known
nor , stooping from the tragic height , drop down
to the low level of buffoon and clown
AABB
as though pert davus , or the saucy jade
who sacks the gold and jeers the gull she made
were like silenus , who , though quaint and odd
is yet the guide and tutor of a god
AABB
a hackneyed subject i would take and treat
so deftly , all should hope to do the feat
then , having strained and struggled , should concede
to do the feat were difficult indeed
AABB
and now the youthful , gay , capricious spring
piercing her showery clouds with crystal light
and with their hues reflected streaking bright
her radiant bow , bids all her warblers sing
ABBA
the lark , shrill caroling on soaring wing
the lonely thrush , in brake , with blossoms white
that tunes his pipe so loud ; while , from the sight
coy bending their dropt heads , young cowslips fling
ABBA
rich perfume o'er the fields .— it is the prime
of hours that beauty robes :— yet all they gild
cheer , and delight in this their fragrant time
for thy dear sake , to me less pleasure yield
ABAB
“ perverse mankind ! whose wills , created free
charge all their woes on absolute degree
all to the dooming gods their guilt translate
and follies are miscall 'd the crimes of fate
AABB
when to his lust aegysthus gave the rein
did fate , or we , the adulterous act constrain
did fate , or we , when great atrides died
urge the bold traitor to the regicide
AABB
hermes i sent , while yet his soul remain 'd
sincere from royal blood , and faith profaned
to warn the wretch , that young orestes , grown
to manly years , should re assert the throne
AABB
whoever thinks a faultless piece to see
thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be
in every work regard the writer 's end
since none can compass more than they intend
AABB
and if the means be just , the conduct true
applause , in spite of trivial faults , is due
as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit
to avoid great errors , must the less commit
AABB
neglect the rules each verbal critic lays
for not to know some trifles is a praise
most critics , fond of some subservient art
still make the whole depend upon a part
AABB
and atm â spoke , with love and wonder bold
“ tread i the valley where the fadeless vine
drops dew immortal and sweet spices grow
from fragrant roots which in that blessed mould
ABBA
watered by tears of penitential woe
drank deep of primal peace and balm divine
when in the morn of time the tale was told
of forfeit happiness and ruined shrine
ABAB
tell me , o beauteous spirit of the bower
is it thy gentle task when others sleep
to guard all that a fallen world may keep
of pristine bliss and lost felicities
ABBA
now seraphs crown 'd with helmets i behold
helmets of substance more refin 'd than gold
the skies with an united lustre shine
and face to face th ’ immortal armies joyn
AABB
god 's plated son , majestically gay
urges his chariot thro ’ the chrystal way
breaks down their ranks , and thunders , as he flies
arms in his hands , and terrour in his eyes
AABB
o'er heav'ns wide arch the routed squadrons rore
and transfix d angels groan upon the diamond floor
then , wheeling from olympus snowy top
thro ’ the scorch 'd air the giddy leaders drop
AABB
where are the others ? voices from the deep
caverns of darkness answer me : “ they sleep
i name no names ; instinctively i feel
each at some well remembered grave will kneel
AABB
and from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss
for every heart best knoweth its own loss
i see their scattered gravestones gleaming white
through the pale dusk of the impending night
AABB
o'er all alike the impartial sunset throws
its golden lilies mingled with the rose
we give to each a tender thought , and pass
out of the graveyards with their tangled grass
AABB
i was no coward . country bred and born
i had no feeling but the keenest scorn
for those fine lady “ ah 's ” and “ oh 's ” of fear
so much assumed ( when any man is near
AABB
thus having said , the hero bound his brows
with leafy branches , then perform 'd his vows
adoring first the genius of the place
then earth , the mother of the heav'nly race
AABB
the nymphs , and native godheads yet unknown
and night , and all the stars that gild her sable throne
and ancient cybel , and idaean jove
and last his sire below , and mother queen above
AABB
then heav'n ' s high monarch thunder 'd thrice aloud
and thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud
soon thro ’ the joyful camp a rumor flew
the time was come their city to renew
AABB
oh , beauty , passing beauty ! sweetest sweet
how canst thou let me waste my youth in sighs
i only ask to sit beside thy feet
thou knowest i dare not look into thine eyes
ABAB
might i but kiss thy hand ! i dare not fold
my arms about thee — scarcely dare to speak
and nothing seems to me so wild and bold
as with one kiss to touch thy bless è d cheek
ABAB
methinks if i should kiss thee , no control
within the thrilling brain could keep afloat
the subtle spirit . even while i spoke
the bare word kiss hath made my inner soul
ABBA
more yet and more , and yet we mark not all
the warning fain to bid fair women heed
its hard brief note of deadly doom and deed
the verse that strewed too thick with flowers the hall
ABBA
whence nero watched his fiery festival
that iron page wherein men 's eyes who read
see , bruised and marred between two babes that bleed
a mad red handed husband 's martyr fall
ABBA
the scene which crossed and streaked with mirth the strife
of henry with his sons and witchlike wife
and that sweet pageant of the kindly fiend
who , seeing three friends in spirit and heart made one
AABB
much have i travelled in the realms of gold
and many goodly states and kingdoms seen
round many western islands have i been
which bards in fealty to apollo hold
ABBA
oft of one wide expanse had i been told
that deep browed homer ruled as his demesne
yet did i never breathe its pure serene
till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold
ABBA
then felt i like some watcher of the skies
when a new planet swims into his ken
or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes
he stared at the pacific — and all his men
ABAB
yes , thou shalt smile again !— time always heals
in youth , the wounds of sorrow .— o ! survey
yon now subsided deep , thro ’ night a prey
to warring winds , and to their furious peals
ABBA
surging tumultuous !— yet , as in dismay
the settling billows tremble .— morning steals
grey on the rocks ;— and soon , to pour the day
from the streak 'd east , the radiant orb unveils
ABAB
in all his pride of light .— thus shall the glow
of beauty , health , and hope , by soft degrees
spread o'er thy breast ; disperse these storms of woe
wake , with sweet pleasure 's sense , the wish to please
ABAB
beneath the thorn was good sir ambrose found
his guests an ample crescent form 'd around
nature 's own carpet spread the space between
where blithe domestics plied in gold and green
AABB
the venerable chaplain waved his wand
and silence follow 'd as he stretch 'd his hand
and with a trembling voice , and heart sincere
implored a blessing on th ’ abundant cheer
AABB
down sat the mingling throng , and shared a feast
with hearty welcomes given , by love increased
a patriarch family , a close link 'd band
true to their rural chieftain , heart and hand
AABB
highmindedness , a jealousy for good
a loving kindness for the great man 's fame
dwells here and there with people of no name
in noisome alley , and in pathless wood
ABBA
and where we think the truth least understood
oft may be found a “ singleness of aim
that ought to frighten into hooded shame
a money mong'ring , pitiable brood
ABBA
i ask not for those thoughts , that sudden leap
from being 's sea , like the isle seeming kraken
with whose great rise the ocean all is shaken
and a heart tremble quivers through the deep
ABBA
give me that growth which some perchance deem sleep
wherewith the steadfast coral stems uprise
which , by the toil of gathering energies
their upward way into clear sunshine keep
ABBA
until , by heaven 's sweetest influences
slowly and slowly spreads a speck of green
into a pleasant island in the seas
where , mid fall palms , the cane roofed home is seen
ABAB
where coral reefs gnaw with white cruel teeth
the yellow surf , and the torn billows seethe
when shines the southern cross o ’ er placid isles
the afric mother sits , and singing , smiles
AABB
unheeding that a dead world ’ s hidden pain
beats wildly rhythmic through her pure refrain
and lingers softly still an echoed sigh
low in earth ’ s cradle song — sweet lullaby
AABB
a warning song of doom — a song of woe
of terror wild , she sings , down bending low
the while bright gleams the starry cross above
yet tells to her no tale of tender love
AABB
when satisfied the smart gallant appeared
and anxiously to putting off adhered
pretending that the wind and tide would fail
the galleys sometimes were unfit to sail
AABB
repairs required ; then further heard the news
that certain pirates had unpleasant views
to fall upon the escort they 'd contrived
at length , a pirate suddenly arrived
AABB
surprized the party left upon the shore
destroyed the whole ; then sought the house for more
and scaled the walls while darkness spread around
the pirate was grifonio 's second found
AABB
thus having said , the father of the fires
to the black labours of his forge retires
soon as he bade them blow , the bellows turn ’ d
their iron mouths ; and where the furnace burn ’ d
AABB
resounding breathed : at once the blast expires
and twenty forges catch at once the fires
just as the god directs , now loud , now low
they raise a tempest , or they gently blow
AABB
in hissing flames huge silver bars are roll ’ d
and stubborn brass , and tin , and solid gold
before , deep fix ’ d , the eternal anvils stand
the ponderous hammer loads his better hand
AABB
a sudden horror all the assembly shook
when slowly rising , halitherses spoke
( reverend and wise , whose comprehensive view
at once the present and the future knew
AABB
“ me too , ye fathers , hear ! from you proceed
the ills ye mourn ; your own the guilty deed
ye gave your sons , your lawless sons , the rein
( oft warn 'd by mentor and myself in vain
AABB
an absent hero 's bed they sought to soil
an absent hero 's wealth they made their spoil
immoderate riot , and intemperate lust
the offence was great , the punishment was just
AABB
with sense of wrong and outrage desperate
strode on and thundered at the palace gate
rushed through the court yard , thrusting in his rage
to right and left each seneschal and page
AABB
and hurried up the broad and sounding stair
his white face ghastly in the torches ’ glare
from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed
voices and cries he heard , but did not heed
AABB
the simple service reached at last its close
when the sick brother to some hearers goes
to learn their welfare , and his own impart
with strongest tokens of a friendly heart
AABB
those persons were both english — man and wife
who knew , for years , the toils of bush farm life
to them was introduced the new made preacher
just then mistaken for an older teacher
AABB
due explanations made , they him invite
to call and see them , and stay over night
he , nothing loath , the invitation kind
at once accepted , with delighted mind
AABB
and then with her round , brown arms she pressed
his phantom form to her throbbing breast
and whispered the name , in her happy sleep
of her h ó h è hunter so fair and far
AABB
the little , wizened , mysterious man
with his long locks tossed by the moaning breeze
then a flap of wings , like a thunder bird
and a wailing spirit the sleeper heard
AABB
happy in sleep , waking content to languish
embracing clouds by night , in daytime mourn
my joys but shadows , touch of truth my anguish
griefs ever springing , comforts never born
ABAB
and still expecting when she will relent
grown hoarse with crying , “ mercy , mercy give
so many vows and prayers having spent
that weary of my life i loathe to live
ABAB
and yet the hydra of my cares renews
still new born sorrows of her fresh disdain
and still my hope the summer winds pursues
finding no end nor period of my pain
ABAB
“ behold an action , gods ! that claims your care
lo great æ neas rushing to the war
against pelides he directs his course
phoebus impels , and phoebus gives him force
AABB
restrain his bold career ; at least , to attend
our favour ’ d hero , let some power descend
to guard his life , and add to his renown
we , the great armament of heaven , came down
AABB
hereafter let him fall , as fates design
that spun so short his life ’ s illustrious line
but lest some adverse god now cross his way
give him to know what powers assist this day
AABB
is it indeed so ? if i lay here dead
wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine
and would the sun for thee more coldly shine
because of grave damps falling round my head
ABBA
i marvelled , my beloved , when i read
thy thought so in the letter . i am thine
but . . . so much to thee ? can i pour thy wine
while my hands tremble ? then my soul , instead
ABBA
of dreams of death , resumes life 's lower range
then , love me , love ! look on me — breathe on me
as brighter ladies do not count it strange
for love , to give up acres and degree
ABAB
why should i sing in verse ? why should i frame
these sad neglected notes for her dear sake
why should i offer up unto her name
the sweetest sacrifice my youth can make
ABAB
why should i strive to make her live for ever
that never deigns to give me joy to live
why should m'afflicted muse so much endeavour
such honour unto cruelty to give
ABAB
if her defects have purchased her this fame
what should her virtues do , her smiles , her love
if this her worst , how should her best inflame
what passions would her milder favours move
ABAB
now comes the bonny may , dancing and skipping
across the stepping stones of meadow streams
bearing no kin to april showers a weeping
but constant sunshine as her servant seems
ABAB
her heart is up — her sweetness , all a maying
streams in her face , like gems on beauty 's breast
the swains are sighing all , and well a daying
lovesick and gazing on their lovely guest
ABAB
the sunday paths , to pleasant places leading
are graced by couples linking arm in arm
sweet smiles enjoying or some book a reading
where love and beauty are the constant charm
ABAB
loud blew the north thro ’ april 's pallid days
nor grass the field , nor leaves the grove obtains
nor crystal sun beams , nor the gilded rains
that bless the hours of promise , gently raise
ABBA
warmth in the blood , without that fiery blaze
which makes it boil along the throbbing veins
albion , displeas 'd , her own lov 'd spring surveys
passing , with volant step , o'er russet plains
ABAB
i hated thee , fallen tyrant ! i did groan
to think that a most unambitious slave
like thou , shouldst dance and revel on the grave
of liberty . thou mightst have built thy throne
ABBA
where it had stood even now : thou didst prefer
a frail and bloody pomp which time has swept
in fragments towards oblivion . massacre
for this i prayed , would on thy sleep have crept
ABAB
treason and slavery , rapine , fear , and lust
and stifled thee , their minister . i know
too late , since thou and france are in the dust
that virtue owns a more eternal foe
ABAB
my tears are true . though others be divine
and sing of wars and troy 's new rising frame
meeting heroic feet in every line
that tread high measures in the scene of fame
ABAB
and i , though disaccustoming my muse
and sing but low songs in an humble vein
may one day raise my style as others use
and turn elizon to a higher strain
ABAB
when re intombing from oblivious ages
in better stanzas her surviving wonder
i may opposed against the monster rage
that part desert and excellence asunder
ABAB
at last arrived that most important day
when they from all must tear themselves away
and feel , what emigrants had felt before
that parting scenes to tender hearts are sore
AABB
their christian brethren did them all commend
to their kind father , savior , guide and friend
and gave to them , as pledge of their regard
a bagster 's bible — god 's own precious word
AABB
their kind , deep feelings , other friends displayed
by various gifts , till parting time delayed
and these love tokens sensibly affect
the emigrants , as proof of their respect
AABB
i wrote my sighs , and sent them to my love
i praised that fair that none enough could praise
but plaints nor praises could fair licia move
above my reach she did her virtues raise
ABAB
and thus replied : “ false scrawl , untrue thou art
to feign those sighs that nowhere can be found
for half those praises came not from his heart
whose faith and love as yet was never found
ABAB
thy master 's life , false scrawl shall be thy doom
because he burns , i judge thee to the flame
both your attempts deserve no better room
thus at her word we ashes both became
ABAB
amazed at what the lordly devil said
the clod could naught reply , so great his dread
but at the gasconade perretta smiled
who kept his house and weary hours beguiled
AABB
a sprightly clever lass , with prying eye
who , when a shepherdess , could more descry
than sheep or lambs she watched upon the plain
if other views or points she sought to gain
AABB
said she , weep not , i 'll undertake at ease
to gull this novice devil as i please
he 's young and ignorant ; has nothing seen
thee ; from his rage , i thoroughly will skreen
AABB
some foreign writers , some our own despise
the ancients only , or the moderns prize
thus wit , like faith , by each man is apply 'd
to one small sect , and all are damn 'd beside
AABB
meanly they seek the blessing to confine
and force that sun but on a part to shine
which not alone the southern wit sublimes
but ripens spirits in cold northern climes
AABB
which from the first has shone on ages past
enlights the present , and shall warm the last
tho ’ each may feel increases and decays
and see now clearer and now darker days
AABB
‘ oh , monstrous slander on the human race
then read conviction in ortuno 's case
by nature fashion 'd in her happiest mood
with learning , fancy , keenest wit endued
AABB
to what high purpose , what exalted end
these lofty gifts did great ortuno bend
with grateful triumph did ortuno raise
the mighty trophies to their author 's praise
AABB
with skill deducing from th ’ harmonious whole
immortal proofs of one creative soul
ah , no ! infatuate with the dazzling light
in them he saw their own creative might
AABB
the time has been when nature 's simple face
perennial youth possessed and winning grace
but who shall dare , in this refining age
with nature 's praise to soil his snowy page
AABB
what polish 'd lover , unappall 'd by sneers
dare court a beldame of six thousand years
when every clown with microscopick eyes
the gaping furrows on her forehead spies
AABB
‘ good sir , your pardon : in her naked state
her withered form we cannot chuse but hate
but fashion 's art the waste of time repairs
each wrinkle fills , and dies her silver hairs
AABB
in silence and as though expectantly
she crouches at his feet , while he caresses
his light drawn fingers with the touch of tresses
sleeked round her head , close banded lustrously
ABBA
save where at nape and temple the smooth brown
sleaves out into a pale transparent mist
of hair and tangled light . so to exist
poised ‘ twixt the deep of thought where spirits drown
ABBA
man 's heart may change , but nature 's glory never
though to the sullen gaze of grief the sight
of sun illumined skies may seem less bright
or gathering clouds less grand , yet she , as ever
ABBA
is lovely or majestic . though fate sever
the long linked bands of love , and all delight
be lost , as in a sudden starless night
the radiance may return , if he , the giver
ABBA
of peace on earth , vouchsafe the storm to still
this breast once shaken with the strife of care
is touched with silent joy . the cot — the hill
beyond the broad blue wave — and faces fair
ABAB
of all the kings that ever here did reign
edward named fourth as first in praise i name
not for his fair outside , nor well lined brain
although less gifts imp feathers oft on fame
ABAB
nor that he could , young wise , wise valiant , frame
his sire 's revenge , join 'd with a kingdom 's gain
and , gain 'd by mars , could yet mad mars so tame
that balance weigh 'd what sword did late obtain
ABAB
fly low , dear love , thy sun dost thou not see
take heed , do not so near his rays aspire
lest , for thy pride , inflamed with wreakful ire
it burn thy wings , as it hath burn è d me
ABBA
thou haply sayst thy wings immortal be
and so cannot consum è d be with fire
and one is hope , the other is desire
and that the heavens bestowed them both on thee
ABBA
a muse 's words made thee with hope to fly
an angel 's face desire hath begot
thyself engendered by a goddess ’ eye
yet for all this , immortal thou art not
ABAB
prodigious this ! the frail one of our play
from her own sex should mercy find to day
you might have held the pretty head aside
peep 'd in your fans , been serious thus , and cried
AABB
‘ the play may pass — but that strange creature , shore
i can n't — indeed now — i so hate a whore
just as a blockhead rubs his thoughtless skull
and thanks his stars he was not born a fool
AABB
so from a sister sinner you shall hear
‘ how strangely you expose yourself , my dear
but let me die , all raillery apart
our sex are still forgiving at their heart
AABB
birds of a feather will flock together
the robin sings to his ruddy mate
and the chattering jays , in the winter weather
to prate and gossip will congregate
ABAB
and the cawing crows on the autumn heather
like evil omens , will flock together
in extra session , for high debate
and the lass will slip from a doting mother
AABB
to hang with her lad on the garden gate
birds of a feather will flock together
‘ tis an adage old ,— it is nature 's law
and sure as the pole will the needle draw
AABB
if we should part upon that one embrace
and set our courses ever , each from each
with all our treasure but a fading face
and little ghostly syllables of speech
ABAB
should beauty 's moment never be renewed
and moons on moons look out for us in vain
and each but whisper from a solitude
to hear but echoes of a lonely pain
ABAB
still in a world that fortune cannot change
should walk those two that once were you and i
those two that once when moon and stars were strange
poets above us in an april sky
ABAB
a handmaid to the genius of thy song
is sweet , fair scholarship . ‘ tis she supplies
the fiery spirit of the passioned eyes
with subtle syllables , whose notes belong
ABBA
to some chief source of perfect melodies
and glancing through a laurelled , lordly throng
of shining singers , lo ! my vision flies
to william shakespeare ! he it is whose strong
ABAB
full , flute like music haunts thy stately verse
a worthy levite of his court thou art
one sent among us to defeat the curse
that binds us to the actual . yea , thy part
ABAB
“ new light ! ” men cried , and murmured that it came
from an unsanctioned source with lawless flame
it shone too free , for still the church and school
must only shine according to their rule
AABB
but princeton answered , in her nobler mood
“ god made the light , and all the light is good
there is no war between the old and new
the conflict lies between the false and true
AABB
the stars , that high in heaven their courses run
in glory differ , but their light is one
the beacons , gleaming o'er the sea of life
are rivals but in radiance , not in strife
AABB
new england ! proudly may thy children claim
their honored birthright by its humblest name
cold are thy skies , but , ever fresh and clear
no rank malaria stains thine atmosphere
AABB
no fungous weeds invade thy scanty soil
scarred by the ploughshares of unslumbering toil
long may the doctrines by thy sages taught
raised from the quarries where their sires have wrought
AABB
be like the granite of thy rock ribbed land
as slow to rear , as obdurate to stand
and as the ice that leaves thy crystal mine
chills the fierce alcohol in the creole 's wine
AABB
at the round earth 's imagined corners blow
your trumpets , angels ! and arise , arise
from death , you numberless infinities
of souls , and to your scattered bodies go
ABBA
but let them sleep , lord ! and me mourn a space
for if above all these my sins abound
‘ tis late to ask abundance of thy grace
when we are there . here on this holy ground
ABAB
less bronze , more silver , mingles in the mould
of him whom next my roving eyes behold
his , more the scholar 's than the statesman 's face
proclaims him born of academic race
AABB
weary his look , as if an aching brain
left on his brow the frozen prints of pain
his voice far reaching , grave , sonorous , owns
a shade of sadness in its plaintive tones
AABB
yet when its breath some loftier thought inspires
glows with a heat that every bosom fires
such everett seems ; no chance sown wild flower knows
the full blown charms of culture 's double rose
AABB
thus , anxious , he explored the crowded field
nor once the secret of his birth revealed
heaven will 'd it so . pressed down by silent grief
surrounding objects promised no relief
AABB
this world to mortals still denies repose
and life is still the scene of many woes
again his eye , instinctive turned , descried
the green pavilion , and the warrior 's pride
AABB
again he cries : “ o tell his glorious name
yon gallant horse declares the hero 's fame
but false huj í r the aspiring hope repelled
crushed the fond wish , the soothing balm withheld
AABB
that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
for slander 's mark was ever yet the fair
the ornament of beauty is suspect
a crow that flies in heaven 's sweetest air
ABAB
so thou be good , slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater being wooed of time
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
and thou present'st a pure unstained prime
ABAB
thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
either not assailed , or victor being charged
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
to tie up envy , evermore enlarged
ABAB
o that you were your self , but love you are
no longer yours , than you your self here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
ABAB
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination , then you were
your self again after your self 's decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
ABAB
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honour might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winter 's day
and barren rage of death 's eternal cold
ABAB
dear chorister , who from those shadows sends
ere that the blushing morn dare show her light
such sad , lamenting strains , that night attends
become all ear ; stars stay to hear thy plight
ABAB
if one whose grief even reach of thought transcends
who ne'er , not in a dream , did taste delight
may thee importune who like case pretends
and seems to joy in woe , in woe 's despite
ABAB
tell me ( so may thou fortune milder try
and long , long sing ) for what thou thus complains
since winter 's gone , and sun in dappled sky
enamour 'd , smiles on woods and flowery plains
ABAB
there were not many at that lonely place
where two scourged hills met in a little plain
the wind cried loud in gusts , then low again
three pines strained darkly , runners in a race
ABBA
unseen by any . toward the further woods
a dim harsh noise of voices rose and ceased
— we were most silent in those solitudes
then , sudden as a flame , the black robed priest
ABAB
the clotted earth piled roughly up about
the hacked red oblong of the new made thing
short words in swordlike latin — and a rout
of dreams most impotent , unwearying
ABAB
as some lone miser , visiting his store
bends at his treasure , counts , recounts it o'er
hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill
yet still he sighs , for hoards are wanting still
AABB
thus to my breast alternate passions rise
pleased with each good that heaven to man supplies
yet oft a sigh prevails , and sorrows fall
to see the hoard of human bliss so small
AABB
and oft i wish amidst the scene to find
some spot to real happiness consigned
where my worn soul , each wandering hope at rest
may gather bliss to see my fellows blest
AABB
the silence of the storm weighs heavily
on their strained spirits : sometimes one will say
some trivial thing as though to ward away
mysterious powers , that imminently lie
ABBA
in wait , with the strong exorcising grace
of everyday 's futility . desire
becomes upon a sudden a crystal fire
defined and hard :— if he could kiss her face
ABBA
could kiss her hair ! as if by chance , her hand
brushes on his ... ah , can she understand
or is she pedestalled above the touch
of his desire ? he wonders : dare he seek
AABB
and canst not tell when to this spot return
there is our lordly mansion here ; there is
our wealth , and here i am thy youthful wife
why go away and risk thy precious life
AABB
a hundred thousand birds salute the day
one solitary bird salutes the night
its mellow grieving wiles our grief away
and tunes our weary watches to delight
ABAB
it seems to sing the thoughts we cannot say
to know and sing them , and to set them right
until we feel once more that may is may
and hope some buds may bloom without a blight
ABAB
this solitary bird outweighs , outvies
the hundred thousand merry making birds
whose innocent warblings yet might make us wise
would we but follow when they bid us rise
AABB
wythe , mason , pendleton with henry join 'd
rush , rodney , langdon , friends of humankind
persuasive dickinson , the former 's boast
recording thomson , pride of all the host
AABB
nash , jay , the livingstons , in council great
rutledge and laurens held the rolls of fate
o'er wide creation turn 'd their ardent eyes
and bade the opprest to selfexistence rise
AABB
all powers of state , in their extended plan
spring from consent , to shield the rights of man
undaunted wolcott urged the holy cause
with steady hand the solemn scene he draws
AABB
darkness like midnight from the sobbing woods
clamours with dismal tidings of the rain
roaring as rivers breaking loose in floods
to spread and foam and deluge all the plain
ABAB
the cotter listens at his door again
half doubting whether it be floods or wind
and through the thickening darkness looks afraid
thinking of roads that travel has to find
ABAB
some glory in their birth , some in their skill
some in their wealth , some in their body 's force
some in their garments though new fangled ill
some in their hawks and hounds , some in their horse
ABAB
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
wherein it finds a joy above the rest
but these particulars are not my measure
all these i better in one general best
ABAB
thy love is better than high birth to me
richer than wealth , prouder than garments ’ costs
of more delight than hawks and horses be
and having thee , of all men 's pride i boast
ABAB
when i behold that beauties wonderment
and rare perfection of each goodly part
of natures skill the onely complement
i honor and admire the makers art
ABAB
but when i feele the bitter balefull smart
which her fayre eyes unwares doe worke in mee
that death out of theyr shiny beames doe dart
i thinke that i a new pandora see
ABAB
whom all the gods in councell did agree
into this sinfull world from heaven to send
that she to wicked men a scourge should bee
for all their faults with which they did offend
ABAB
her match in beautie was not anie one
shortly within her inmost pith there bred
a litle wicked worme , perceiv 'd of none
that on her sap and vitall moysture fed
ABAB
thenceforth her garland so much honoured
began to die , o great ruth * for the same
and her faire lockes fell from her loftie head
that shortly balde and bared she became
ABAB
thus then he disappeared , was rarified
for ‘ tis improper speech to say he died
he was exhaled ; his great creator drew
his spirit , as the sun the morning dew
AABB
‘ tis sin produces death ; and he had none
but the taint adam left on every son
he added not , he was so pure , so good
‘ twas but the original forfeit of his blood
AABB
and that so little , that the river ran
more clear than the corrupted fount began
nothing remain 'd of the first muddy clay
the length of course had wash 'd it in the way
AABB
black grows the southern sky , betokening rain
and humming hive bees homeward hurry bye
they feel the change ; so let us shun the grain
and take the broad road while our feet are dry
ABAB
ay , there some dropples moistened on my face
and pattered on my hat — tis coming nigh
let 's look about , and find a sheltering place
the little things around , like you and i
ABAB
are hurrying through the grass to shun the shower
here stoops an ash tree — hark ! the wind gets high
but never mind ; this ivy , for an hour
rain as it may , will keep us dryly here
ABAB
thou blind fool love , what dost thou to mine eyes
that they behold and see not what they see
they know what beauty is , see where it lies
yet what the best is , take the worst to be
ABAB
if eyes corrupt by over partial looks
be anchored in the bay where all men ride
why of eyes ’ falsehood hast thou forged hooks
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
ABAB
why should my heart think that a several plot
which my heart knows the wide world 's common place
or mine eyes seeing this , say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face
ABAB
oh , for the time gone by , when thought of christ
made his yoke easy and his burden light
when my heart stirred within me at the sight
of altar spread for awful eucharist
ABBA
when all my hopes his promises sufficed
when my soul watched for him by day , by night
when my lamp lightened and my robe was white
and all seemed loss , except the pearl unpriced
ABBA
yet , since he calls me still with tender call
since he remembers whom i half forgot
i even will run my race and bear my lot
for faith the walls of jericho cast down
ABBA
the ticking — ticking — ticking of the clock
that vexed me so last night —! “ for though time keeps
such drowsy watch , ” i moaned , “ he never sleeps
but only nods above the world to mock
ABBA
its restless occupant , then rudely rock
it as the cradle of a babe that weeps
i seemed to see the seconds piled in heaps
like sand about me ; and at every shock
ABBA
o ’ the bell , the piled sands were swirled away
as by a desert storm that swept the earth
stark as a granary floor , whereon the gray
and mist bedrizzled moon amidst the dearth
ABAB
i am a little world , made cunningly
of elements and an angelic sprite
but black sin hath betrayed to endless night
my world 's both parts , and oh ! both parts must die
ABBA
you , which beyond that heaven , which was most high
have found new spheres , and of new land can write
pour new seas in mine eyes , that so i might
drown my world with my weeping earnestly
ABBA
or wash it , if it must be drowned no more
but oh ! it must be burnt ; alas ! the fire
of lust and envy burnt it heretofore
and made it fouler ; let their flames retire
ABAB
wings have we , and as far as we can go
we may find pleasure : wilderness and wood
blank ocean and mere sky , support that mood
which with the lofty sanctifies the low
ABBA
dreams , books , are each a world ; and books , we know
are a substantial world , both pure and good
round these , with tendrils strong as flesh and blood
our pastime and our happiness will grow
ABBA
there do i find a never failing store
of personal themes , and such as i love best
matter wherein right voluble i am
two will i mention , dearer than the rest
ABAB
whilst echo cries , “ what shall become of me
and desolate , my desolations pity
thou in thy beauty 's carack sitt'st to see
my tragic downfall , and my funeral ditty
ABAB
only regardless to the world thou leav'st me
whilst slain hopes , turning from the feast of sorrow
unto despair , their king , which ne'er deceives me
captives my heart , whose black night hates the morrow
ABAB
the richest relic rome did ever view
was ’ c æ sar 's tomb ; on which , with cunning hand
jove 's triple honours , the three fair graces , stand
telling his virtues in their virtues true
ABBA
this rome admired ; but dearest dear , in you
dwelleth the wonder of the happiest land
and all the world to neptune 's furthest strand
for what rome shaped hath living life in you
ABBA
thy naked beauty , bounteously displayed
enricheth monarchies of hearts with love
thine eyes to hear complaints are open laid
thine eyes ’ kind looks requite all pains i prove
ABAB
as kings who see their little life day pass
take off the heavy ermine and the crown
so had the trees that autumn time laid down
their golden garments on the faded grass
ABBA
when i , who watched the seasons in the glass
of mine own thoughts , saw all the autumn 's brown
leap into life and don a sunny gown
of leafage such as happy april has
ABBA
great spring came singing upward from the south
for in my heart , far carried on the wind
your words like winged seeds took root and grew
and all the world caught music from your mouth
ABBA
thrice happy he , who by some shady grove
far from the clamorous world , doth live his own
though solitary , who is not alone
but doth converse with that eternal love
ABBA
o how more sweet is birds ’ harmonious moan
or the soft sobbings of the widowed dove
than those smooth whisperings near a prince 's throne
which good make doubtful , do the evil approve
ABAB
or how more sweet is zephyr 's wholesome breath
and sighs perfumed which do the flowers unfold
than that applause vain honor doth bequeath
how sweet are streams to poison drunk in gold
ABAB
an hideous dragon , dreadfull to behold
whose backe was arm 'd against the dint of speare
with shields of brasse that shone like burnisht golde
and forkhed sting that death in it did beare
ABAB
which , through his entrailes spredding diversly
made him to swell , that nigh his bowells brust
and him enforst to yeeld the victorie
that did so much in his owne greatnesse trust
ABAB
the god obeys , and to his feet applies
those golden wings that cut the yielding skies
his ample hat his beamy locks o'erspread
and veil 'd the starry glories of his head
AABB
he seized the wand that causes sleep to fly
or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye
that drives the dead to dark tartarean coasts
or back to life compels the wandering ghosts
AABB
thus through the parting clouds the son of may
wings on the whistling winds his rapid way
now smoothly steers through air his equal flight
now springs aloft , and towers th ’ ethereal height
AABB
dear craoibhin aoibhin , look into our case
when we are high and airy hundreds say
that if we hold that flight they 'll leave the place
while those same hundreds mock another day
ABAB
because we have made our art of common things
so bitterly , you 'd dream they longed to look
all their lives through into some drift of wings
you 've dandled them and fed them from the book
ABAB
and know them to the bone ; impart to us
we 'll keep the secret — a new trick to please
is there a bridle for this proteus
that turns and changes like his draughty seas
ABAB
they flout me as half english — a disgrace
for which scarce all your virtues can atone
mother , in whom i find no flaw but one
that you are saxon !— but this fault of race
ABBA
fell not on me nor yet , i fear , your grace
of english speech , else had more smoothly run
these echoes of welsh lyrics , and your son
need not have flinched before the critic 's face
ABBA
the city slept beneath the moonbeam 's glance
her white walls gleaming through the vines of france
and all was hushed , save where the footsteps fell
on some high tower , of midnight sentinel
AABB
but one still watched ; no self encircled woes
chased from his lids the angel of repose
he watched , he wept , for thoughts of bitter years
bowed his dark lashes , wet with burning tears
AABB
his country 's sufferings and her children 's shame
streamed o'er his memory like a forest 's flame
each treasured insult , each remembered wrong
rolled through his heart and kindled into song
AABB
within this wood , out of a rocke did rise
a spring of water , mildly rumbling downe
whereto approched not in anie wise
the homely shepheard , nor the ruder clowne
ABAB
but , while herein i tooke my chiefe delight
i saw , alas ! the gaping earth devoure
the spring , the place , and all cleane out of sight
which yet aggreeves my hart even to this houre
ABAB
among the wondrous ways of men and time
he went as one that ever found and sought
and bore in hand the lamplike spirit of thought
to illume with instance of its fire sublime
ABBA
no virtue girt and armed and helmed with light
no love more lovely than the snows are white
no serpent sleeping in some dead soul 's tomb
no song bird singing from some live soul 's height
AABB
something this foggy day , a something which
is neither of this fog nor of to day
has set me dreaming of the winds that play
past certain cliffs , along one certain beach
ABBA
and turn the topmost edge of waves to spray
ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away
so out of reach while quite within my reach
as out of reach as india or cathay
AABB
stretched on a sunny bank he lay at rest
ferns at his elbow , lilies round his knees
with sweet flesh patterned where the cool turf pressed
flowerlike crept o'er with emerald aphides
ABAB
single he couched there , to his circling flocks
piping at times some happy shepherd 's tune
nude , with the warm wind in his golden locks
and arched with the blue asian afternoon
ABAB
when the first larvae on the elm are seen
the crawling wretches , like its leaves , are green
ere chill october shakes the latest down
they , like the foliage , change their tint to brown
AABB
on the blue flower a bluer flower you spy
you stretch to pluck it — ‘ tis a butterfly
the flattened tree toads so resemble bark
they 're hard to find as ethiops in the dark
AABB
the woodcock , stiffening to fictitious mud
cheats the young sportsman thirsting for his blood
so by long living on a single lie
nay , on one truth , will creatures get its dye
AABB
scorn only , scorn begot of bitter proof
by keen experience of a trustless heart
bears burning in her new born hand the dart
wherewith love dies heart stricken , and the roof
ABBA
falls of his palace , and the storied woof
long woven of many a year with life 's whole art
is rent like any rotten weed apart
and hardly with reluctant eyes aloof
ABBA
cold memory guards one relic scarce exempt
yet from the fierce corrosion of contempt
and hardly saved by pity . woe are we
that once we loved , and love not ; but we know
AABB
thou pain , the only guest of loathed constraint
the child of curse , man 's weakness foster child
brother to woe , and father of complaint
thou pain , thou hated pain , from heaven exiled
ABAB
what courage strange hath caught thy caitiff heart
fear'st not a face that oft whole hearts devours
or art thou from above bid play this part
and so no help ‘ gainst envy of those powers
ABAB
why are we by all creatures waited on
why do the prodigal elements supply
life and food to me , being more pure than i
simpler , and further from corruption
ABBA
weaker i am , woe 's me ! and worse than you
you have not sinned , nor need be timorous
but wonder at a greater , for to us
created nature doth these things subdue
ABBA
behold what hap pygmalion had to frame
and carve his proper grief upon a stone
my heavy fortune is much like the same
i work on flint and that 's the cause i moan
ABAB
for hapless lo , even with mine own desires
i figured on the table of my heart
the fairest form that the world 's eye admires
and so did perish by my proper art
ABAB
and still i toil to change the marble breast
of her whose sweetest grace i do adore
yet cannot find her breathe unto my rest
hard is her heart , and woe is me therefore
ABAB
huge elm , with rifted trunk all notched and scarred
like to a warrior 's destiny ! i love
to stretch me often on thy shadowed sward
and hear the laugh of summer leaves above
ABAB
or on thy buttressed roots to sit , and lean
in careless attitude , and there reflect
on times , and deeds , and darings that have been
old castaways , now swallowed in neglect
ABAB
while thou art towering in thy strength of heart
stirring the soul to vain imaginings
in which life 's sordid being hath no part
the wind of that eternal ditty sings
ABAB
oh ! that my conscience were but clear within
which now is racked with my former sin
with horror i behold my secret stealing
my bribes , oppression , and my graceless dealing
AABB
my office sins , which i had clean forgotten
will gnaw my soul when all my bones are rotten
i must confess it , very grief doth force me
dead or alive , both god and man doth curse me
AABB
brave ships are these that bear thee home again
from under far off skies — brave flags that fly
above the deck whereon thine ashes lie
waiting their urn beyond the alien main
ABBA
the nations pause to view thy funeral train
as slowly moving up ‘ twixt sea and sky
it comes with stately pomp , and liberty
holds out her hands and calls thy name in vain
ABBA
and yet , mayhap , in vision vague and sweet
another sight thou seest beyond the boast
of patriot pride — beside the new born fleet
spectral and strange , no guest for such a host
ABAB
who , rapt with wonder of their famous praise
admire their statues , their colossoes great
their rich triumphall arcks which they did raise
their huge pyr á mids , which do heaven threat
ABAB
lo ! one , whom later age hath brought to light
matchable to the greatest of those great
great both by name , and great in power and might
and meriting a meere ** triumphant seate
ABAB
on village green , whose smooth and well worn sod
cross path 'd with every gossip 's foot is trod
by cottage door where playful children run
and cats and curs sit basking in the sun
AABB
a mind but ill at ease . with motions strange
his listless limbs their wayward postures change
whilst many a crooked line and curious maze
with clouted shoon , he on the sand pourtrays
AABB
‘ has truth no charms ? ’ when first beheld , i grant
but , wanting novelty , has every want
for pleasure 's thrill the sickly palate flies
save haply pungent with a rare surprise
AABB
the humble toad that leaps her nightly round
the harmless tenant of the garden ground
is loath 'd , abhor 'd , nay , all the reptile race
together join 'd were never half so base
AABB
yet snugly find her in some quarry pent
through ages doom 'd to one tremendous lent
surviving still , as if “ in nature 's spite
without or nourishment , or air , or light
AABB
if i must die , o let me chuse my death
suck out my soul with kisses , cruel maid
in thy breasts crystal balls embalm my breath
dole it all out in sighs when i am laid
ABAB
thy lips on mine like cupping glasses clasp
let our tongues meet , and strive as they would sting
crush out my wind with one straight girting grasp
stabs on my heart keep time whilst thou dost sing
ABAB
thy eyes like searing irons burn out mine
in thy fair tresses stifle me outright
like circes , change me to a loathsom swine
so i may live for ever in thy sight
ABAB
but none of these frail beauties and unstable
shall make my pen riot in pompous style
more greater gifts shall my grave muse enable
whereat severer brows shall never smile
ABAB
but , ah ! ye maids , beware the gipsy 's lures
she opens not the womb of time , but yours
oft has her hands the hapless marian wrung
marian , whom gay in sweetest strains has sung
AABB
the parson 's maid — sore cause had she to rue
the gipsy 's tongue ; the parson 's daughter too
long had that anxious daughter sighed to know
what vellum 's sprucy clerk , the valley 's beau
AABB
meant by those glances which at church he stole
her father nodding to the psalm 's slow drawl
long had she sighed ; at length a prophet came
by many a sure prediction known to fame
AABB
a host of things i take on trust : i take
the nightingales on trust , for few and far
between those actual summer moments are
when i have heard what melody they make
ABBA
so chanced it once at como on the lake
but all things , then , waxed musical ; each star
sang on its course , each breeze sang on its car
all harmonies sang to senses wide awake
ABBA
all things in tune , myself not out of tune
those nightingales were nightingales indeed
yet truly an owl had satisfied my need
and wrought a rapture underneath that moon
ABBA
a mightier power the strong direction sends
and several men impels to several ends
like varying winds , by other passions tost
this drives them constant to a certain coast
AABB
let power or knowledge , gold or glory , please
or ( oft more strong than all ) the love of ease
through life ‘ tis follow 'd , even at life 's expense
the merchant 's toil , the sage 's indolence
AABB
art thou already weary of the way
thou who hast yet but half the way gone o'er
get up , and lift thy burthen : lo , before
thy feet the road goes stretching far away
ABBA
if thou already faint , who hast but come
through half thy pilgrimage , with fellows gay
love , youth , and hope , under the rosy bloom
and temperate airs , of early breaking day
ABAB
he 's a worker of magic and wonderful wise
he cries when he laughs and he laughs when he cries
he sweats when he 's cold , and he shivers when hot
and the water is cold in his boiling pot
AABB
he hides in the earth and he walks in disguise
but he loves the brave and their sacrifice
we are sons of hey ó ka . the giant commands
in the boiling water to thrust our hands
AABB
if i let fall a word of bitter mirth
when public shames more shameful pardon won
some have misjudged me , and my service done
if small , yet faithful , deemed of little worth
ABBA
through veins that drew their life from western earth
two hundred years and more my blood hath run
in no polluted course from sire to son
and thus was i predestined ere my birth
ABBA
to love the soil wherewith my fibres own
instinctive sympathies ; yet love it so
as honor would , nor lightly to dethrone
judgment , the stamp of manhood , nor forego
ABAB
for it is written , “ god shall wipe away
tears from all faces , ” in eternal day
then let me rest content , and strive to show
true patience , while i suffer here below
AABB
and follow christ wherever he may lead
thus proving faith sincere by every deed
o , then , whenever he may call me hence
i shall be willing to leave time and sense
AABB
for though he colours could devize at will
and eke his learned hand at pleasure guide
least , trembling , it his workmanship should spill
yet many wondrous things there are beside
ABAB
the sweet eye glaunces , that like arrowes glide
the charming smiles , that rob sence from the hart
the lovely pleasance , and the lofty pride
cannot expressed be by any art
ABAB
i lived with visions for my company
instead of men and women , years ago
and found them gentle mates , nor thought to know
a sweeter music than they played to me
ABBA
but soon their trailing purple was not free
of this world 's dust , their lutes did silent grow
and i myself grew faint and blind below
their vanishing eyes . then thou didst come — to be
ABBA
beloved , what they seemed . their shining fronts
their songs , their splendours , ( better , yet the same
as river water hallowed into fonts
met in thee , and from out thee overcame
ABAB
“ ‘ think it not loss of time a while to stay
tho ’ thy companions chide thy long delay
tho ’ summon 'd to the seas , tho ’ pleasing gales
invite thy course , and stretch thy swelling sails
AABB
but beg the sacred priestess to relate
with willing words , and not to write thy fate
the fierce italian people she will show
and all thy wars , and all thy future woe
AABB
and what thou may'st avoid , and what must undergo
she shall direct thy course , instruct thy mind
and teach thee how the happy shores to find
this is what heav'n allows me to relate
ABBA
time , cruel time , come and subdue that brow
which conquers all but thee , and thee too stays
as if she were exempt from scythe or bow
from love or years unsubject to decays
ABAB
or art thou grown in league with those fair eyes
that they may help thee to consume our days
or dost thou spare her for her cruelties
being merciless like thee that no man weighs
ABAB
and yet thou seest thy power she disobeys
cares not for thee , but lets thee waste in vain
and prodigal of hours and years betrays
beauty and youth t'opinion and disdain
ABAB
and have i heard her say , “ o cruel pain
and doth she know what mould her beauty bears
mourns she in truth , and thinks that others feign
fears she to feel , and feels not others ’ fears
ABAB
or doth she think all pain the mind forbears
that heavy earth , not fiery spirits , may plain
that eyes weep worse than heart in bloody tears
that sense feels more than what doth sense contain
ABAB
no , no , she is too wise , she knows her face
hath not such pain as it makes others have
she knows the sickness of that perfect place
hath yet such health , as it my life can save
ABAB
thro ’ changing months a well attemper 'd mind
welcomes their gentle or terrific pace
when o'er retreating autumn 's golden grace
tempestuous winter spreads in every wind
ABBA
naked asperity , our musings find
grandeur increasing , as the glooms efface
variety and glow .— each solemn trace
exalts the thoughts , from sensual joys refin 'd
ABBA
then blended in our rapt ideas rise
the vanish 'd charms , that summer suns reveal
with all of desolation , that now lies
dreary before us ;— teach the soul to feel
ABAB
safe from the storm ; the harbor lights of peace
before his eyes ; the burden of dark fears
cast from him like a cloak ; and in his ears
the heart beat music of a great release
ABBA
captain and pilot , back upon the seas
whose wrath he 'd weathered , back he looks with tears
seeing no shadow of the death that nears
stealthy and sure , with sudden agonies
ABBA
and if with thee some hapless maid should stray
disastrous love companion of her way
oh , lead her timid steps to yonder glade
whose arching cliffs depending alders shade
AABB
there , as meek evening wakes her temperate breeze
and moonbeams glimmer through the trembling trees
the rills that gurgle round shall soothe her ear
the weeping rocks shall number tear for tear
AABB
there as sad philomel , alike forlorn
sings to the night from her accustomed thorn
while at sweet intervals each falling note
sighs in the gale , and whispers round the grot
AABB
“ teacups , arouse ! ” ‘ t was thus the spell i broke
the drowsy started and the slumberers woke
“ the sleep i promised you have now enjoyed
due to your hour of labor well employed
AABB
swiftly the busy moments have been passed
this , our first ‘ teacups , ’ must not be our last
here , on this spot , now consecrated ground
the order of ‘ the teacups ’ let us found
AABB
by winter 's fireside and in summer 's bower
still shall it claim its ever welcome hour
in distant regions where our feet may roam
the magic teapot find or make a home
AABB
not so , replied the disappointed dame
we 'll put it off :— perhaps ‘ twould hurt your frame
your health i value , and i would advise
to be at ease , take breath , and prudence prize
AABB
apprentice in a shop you now are bound
next ‘ prentice go to some gallant around
you 'll not so soon his pleasing art require
nor to your tutorage can i now aspire
AABB
friend nicaise take some neighb'ring servant maid
you 're quite a master in the shopping trade
stuffs you can sell , and ask the highest price
and to advantage turn things in a trice
AABB
and wilt thou have me fashion into speech
the love i bear thee , finding words enough
and hold the torch out , while the winds are rough
between our faces , to cast light on each
ABBA
i drop it at thy feet . i cannot teach
my hand to hold my spirits so far off
from myself — me — that i should bring thee proof
in words , of love hid in me out of reach
ABBA
nay , let the silence of my womanhood
commend my woman love to thy belief
seeing that i stand unwon , however wooed
and rend the garment of my life , in brief
ABAB
how was i ravisht with your lovely sight
and my frayle thoughts too rashly led astray
whiles diving deepe through amorous insight
on the sweet spoyle of beautie they did pray
ABAB
and twixt her paps , like early fruit in may
whose harvest seemd to hasten now apace
they loosely did theyr wanton winges display
and there to rest themselves did boldly place
ABAB
to gasperin 's so often went our wight
the wife at length became his sole delight
whose youth and beauty were by all confessed
but , ‘ midst these charms , such av'rice she possessed
AABB
the warmest love was checked — a thing not rare
in modern times at least , among the fair
‘ tis true , as i 've already said , with such
sighs naught avail , and promises not much
AABB
without a purse , who wishes should express
would vainly hope to gain a soft caress
the god of love no other charm employs
then cards , and dress , and pleasure 's cheering joys
AABB
down in a valley , by a forest 's side
near where the crystal thames rolls on her waves
i saw a mushroom stand in haughty pride
as if the lilies grew to be his slaves
ABAB
the gentle daisy , with her silver crown
worn in the breast of many a shepherd 's lass
the humble violet , that lowly down
salutes the gay nymphs as they trimly pass
ABAB
these , with a many more , methought , complain 'd
that nature should those needless things produce
which not alone the sun from others gain 'd
but turn it wholly to their proper use
ABAB
wilt thou be still unkind and kill me so
whose humbled vows with sorrowful appeal
do still persist , and did so long ago
intreat for pity with so pure a zeal
ABAB
suffice the world shall , for the world can say
how much thy power hath power , and what it can
never was victor hand yet moved to slay
the rendered captive , or the yielding man
ABAB
then , o , why should thy woman thought impose
death and disdain on him that yields his breath
to free his soul from discontent and woes
and humble sacrifice to a certain death
ABAB
my soul is a stiff pageant , man by man
of some egyptian art than egypt older
found in some tomb whose rite no guess can scan
where all things else to coloured dust did moulder
ABAB
whate ’ er its sense may mean , its age is twin
to that of priesthoods whose feet stood near god
when knowledge was so great that ’ twas a sin
and man ’ s mere soul too man for its abode
ABAB
but when i ask what means that pageant i
and would look at it suddenly , i lose
the sense i had of seeing it , nor can try
again to look , nor hath my memory a use
ABAB
the key will stammer , and the door reply
the hall wake , yawn , and smile ; the torpid stair
will grumble at our feet , the table cry
‘ fetch my belongings for me ; i am bare
ABAB
a clatter ! something in the attic falls
a ghost has lifted up his robes and fled
the loitering shadows move along the walls
then silence very slowly lifts his head
ABAB
the starling with impatient screech has flown
the chimney , and is watching from the tree
they thought us gone for ever : mouse alone
stops in the middle of the floor to see
ABAB
i do not care for kisses . ‘ tis a debt
we paid for the first privilege of love
these are the rains of april which have wet
our fallow hearts and forced their germs to move
ABAB
now the green corn has sprouted . each new day
brings better pleasures , a more dear surprise
the blade , the ear , the harvest — and our way
leads through a region wealthy grown and wise
ABAB
we now compare our fortunes . each his store
displays to kindred eyes of garnered grain
two happy farmers , learned in love 's lore
who weigh and touch and argue and complain
ABAB
whenas her lute is tun è d to her voice
the air grows proud for honour of that sound
and rocks do leap to show how they rejoice
that in the earth such music should be found
ABAB
whenas her hair more worth , more pale than gold
like silver thread lies wafting in the air
diana like she looks , but yet more bold
cruel in chase , more chaste and yet more fair
ABAB
whenas she smiles , the clouds for envy breaks
she jove in pride encounters with a check
the sun doth shine for joy whenas she speaks
thus heaven and earth do homage at her beck
ABAB
this bronze doth keep the very form and mold
of our great martyr 's face . yes , this is he
that brow all wisdom , all benignity
that human , humorous mouth ; those cheeks that hold
ABBA
like some harsh landscape all the summer 's gold
that spirit fit for sorrow , as the sea
for storms to beat on ; the lone agony
those silent , patient lips too well foretold
ABBA
yes , this is he who ruled a world of men
as might some prophet of the elder day
brooding above the tempest and the fray
with deep eyed thought and more than mortal ken
ABBA
how heavy do i journey on the way
when what i seek ( my weary travel 's end
doth teach that case and that repose to say
‘ thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
ABAB
the beast that bears me , tired with my woe
plods dully on , to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
ABAB
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers with a groan
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
ABAB
‘ o child , when my words your sweet youth beguil 'd
i meant to make you the happiest child
i meant that no earthly life should be known
as bless 'd as the life i had made my own
AABB
my weakness and follies i had forgot
but you were happy with me , were you not
i am not worthy my love should come
forsaking for my sake her english home
AABB
i do not care to talk to you although
your speech evokes a thousand sympathies
and all my being 's silent harmonies
wake trembling into music . when you go
ABBA
it is as if some sudden , dreadful blow
had severed all the strings with savage ease
no , do not talk ; but let us rather seize
this intimate gift of silence which we know
ABBA
others may guess your thoughts from what you say
as storms are guessed from clouds where darkness broods
to me the very essence of the day
reveals its inner purpose and its moods
ABAB
why died i not whenas i last did sleep
o sleep too short that shadowed forth my dear
heavens , hear my prayers , nor thus me waking keep
for this were heaven , if thus i sleeping were
ABAB
for in that dark there shone a princely light
two milk white hills , both full of nectar sweet
her ebon thighs , the wonder of my sight
where all my senses with their objects meet
ABAB
i pass these sports , in secret that are best
wherein my thoughts did seem alive to be
we both did strive , and weary both did rest
i kissed her still , and still she kiss è d me
ABAB
what ! and shall we , with such submissive airs
as age demands in reverence from the young
await these crumbs of praise from europe flung
and doubt of our own greatness till it bears
ABBA
the signet of your goethes or voltaires
we who alone in latter times have sung
with scarce less power than arno 's exiled tongue
we who are milton 's kindred , shakespeare 's heirs
ABBA
the prize of lyric victory who shall gain
if ours be not the laurel , ours the palm
more than the froth and flotsam of the seine
more than your hugo flare against the night
ABAB
france , cloven in twain by fire of hell and hate
shamed with the shame of men her meanest born
soldier and judge whose names , inscribed for scorn
stand vilest on the record writ of fate
ABBA
lies yet not wholly vile who stood so great
sees yet not all her praise of old outworn
not yet is all her scroll of glory torn
or left for utter shame to desecrate
ABBA
high souls and constant hearts of faithful men
sustain her perfect praise with tongue and pen
indomitable as honour . storms may toss
and soil her standard ere her bark win home
AABB
read in my face a volume of despairs
the wailing iliads of my tragic woe
drawn with my blood , and painted with my cares
wrought by her hand that i have honoured so
ABAB
who whilst i burn , she sings at my soul 's wrack
looking aloft from turret of her pride
there my soul 's tyrant joys her in the sack
of her own seat , whereof i made her guide
ABAB
there do these smokes that from affliction rise
serve as an incense to a cruel dame
a sacrifice thrice grateful to her eyes
because their power serves to exact the same
ABAB
let me confess that we two must be twain
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots that do with me remain
without thy help , by me be borne alone
ABAB
in our two loves there is but one respect
though in our lives a separable spite
which though it alter not love 's sole effect
yet doth it steal sweet hours from love 's delight
ABAB
i may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
nor thou with public kindness honour me
unless thou take that honour from thy name
ABAB
became a harp whereon his voice and mood
made spheral music round his haloed head
i spake — for then i had not long been dead
“ let me look round upon the vasts , and brood
ABBA
a moment on these orbs ere i decide
what is yon lower star that beauteous shines
and with soft splendor now incarnadines
our wings ?— there would i go and there abide
ABBA
i am a little world , made cunningly
of elements and an angelic sprite
but black sin hath betrayed to endless night
my world 's both parts , and oh ! both parts must die
ABBA
you , which beyond that heaven , which was most high
have found new spheres , and of new land can write
pour new seas in mine eyes , that so i might
drown my world with my weeping earnestly
ABBA
or wash it , if it must be drowned no more
but oh ! it must be burnt ; alas ! the fire
of lust and envy burnt it heretofore
and made it fouler ; let their flames retire
ABAB
then thus to phoebus , in the realms above
spoke from his throne the cloud compelling jove
“ descend , my phoebus ! on the phrygian plain
and from the fight convey sarpedon slain
AABB
then bathe his body in the crystal flood
with dust dishonour ’ d , and deform ’ d with blood
o ’ er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed
and with celestial robes adorn the dead
AABB
between two seas the sea bird 's wing makes halt
wind weary ; while with lifting head he waits
for breath to reinspire him from the gates
that open still toward sunrise on the vault
ABBA
high domed of morning , and in flight 's default
with spreading sense of spirit anticipates
what new sea now may lure beyond the straits
his wings exulting that her winds exalt
ABBA
and fill them full as sails to seaward spread
fulfilled with fair speed 's promise . pass , my song
forth to the haven of thy desire and dread
the presence of our lord , long loved and long
ABAB
the orient beam illumes the parting oar
from yonder azure track , emerging white
the earliest sail slow gains upon the sight
and the blue wave comes rippling to the shore
ABBA
meantime far off the rear of darkness flies
yet ‘ mid the beauties of the morn , unmoved
like one for ever torn from all he loved
back o'er the deep i turn my longing eyes
ABBA
and chide the wayward passions that rebel
yet boots it not to think , or to complain
musing sad ditties to the reckless main
to dreams like these , adieu ! the pealing bell
ABBA
if the blinde furie which warres breedeth oft
wonts not t'enrage the hearts of equall beasts
whether they fare on foote , or flie aloft
or armed be with clawes , or scalie creasts
ABAB
what fell erynnis , with hot burning tongs
did grype your hearts with noysome rage imbew 'd
that , each to other working cruell wrongs
your blades in your owne bowels you embrew 'd
ABAB
was this , ye romanes , your hard destinie
or some old sinne , whose unappeased guilt
powr 'd vengeance forth on you eternallie
or brothers blood , the which at first was spilt
ABAB
at sultry noon too , when our toils were done
we to the gloomy glen were wont to run
there on the turf we lay , while at our feet
the cooling rivulet rippled softly sweet
AABB
and mused on holy theme , and ancient lore
of deeds , and days , and heroes now no more
heard , as his solemn harp isaiah swept
sung woe unto the wicked land — and wept
AABB
or , fancy led , saw jeremiah mourn
in solemn sorrow o'er judea 's urn
then to another shore perhaps would rove
with plato talk in his ilyssian grove
AABB
if thou hadst been a sculptor , what a race
of forms divine had thenceforth filled the land
methinks i see thee , glorious workman , stand
striking a marble window through blind space
ABBA
thy face 's reflex on the coming face
as dawns the stone to statue ‘ neath thy hand
body obedient to its soul 's command
which is thy thought , informing it with grace
ABBA
so had it been . but god , who quickeneth clay
nor turneth it to marble — maketh eyes
not shadowy hollows , where no sunbeams play
would mould his loftiest thought in human guise
ABAB
o ! it is pleasant , with a heart at ease
just after sunset , or by moonlight skies
to make the shifting clouds be what you please
or let the easily persuaded eyes
ABAB
own each quaint likeness issuing from the mould
of a friend 's fancy ; or with head bent low
and cheek aslant see rivers flow of gold
‘ twixt crimson banks ; and then , a traveller , go
ABAB
from mount to mount through cloudland , gorgeous land
or list'ning to the tide , with clos é d sight
be that blind bard , who on the chian strand
by those deep sounds possessed with inward light
ABAB
those lines that i before have writ do lie
even those that said i could not love you dearer
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
ABAB
but reckoning time , whose millioned accidents
creep in ‘ twixt vows , and change decrees of kings
tan sacred beauty , blunt the sharp'st intents
divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things
ABAB
alas why fearing of time 's tyranny
might i not then say ‘ now i love you best
when i was certain o'er incertainty
crowning the present , doubting of the rest
ABAB
o garden isle , beloved by sun and sea
whose bluest billows kiss thy curving bays
whose light infolds thy hills with golden rays
filling with fruit each dark leaved orange tree
ABBA
what hidden hatred hath the earth for thee
that once again , in these dark , dreadful days
breaks forth in trembling rage , and swiftly lays
thy beauty waste in wreck and agony
ABBA
is nature , then , a strife of jealous powers
and man the plaything of unconscious fate
not so , my troubled heart ! god reigns above
and man is greatest in his darkest hours
ABBA
oft as by chance , a little while apart
the pall of empty , loveless hours withdrawn
sweet beauty , opening on the impoverished heart
beams like the jewel on the breast of dawn
ABAB
not though high heaven should rend would deeper awe
fill me than penetrates my spirit thus
nor all those signs the patmian prophet saw
seem a new heaven and earth so marvelous
ABAB
but , clad thenceforth in iridescent dyes
the fair world glistens , and in after days
the memory of kind lips and laughing eyes
lives in my step and lightens all my face
ABAB
“ i ceased , when affable the goddess cried
‘ observe , and in the truths i speak confide
the oracular seer frequents the pharian coast
from whose high bed my birth divine i boast
AABB
proteus , a name tremendous o'er the main
the delegate of neptune 's watery reign
watch with insidious care his known abode
there fast in chains constrain the various god
AABB
who bound , obedient to superior force
unerring will prescribe your destined course
if , studious on your realms , you then demand
their state , since last you left your natal land
AABB
“ why art thou sad , my soul ? the eye divine
still looks on all ; to grieve is to repine
and tho ’ destruction cover all the shore
tho ’ heroes , kings , and statesmen be no more
AABB
tho ’ stenon , vainly mild , and vainly brave
fill the dark bosom of the dreary grave
tho ’ sweden 's sons no earthly hope retain
tho ’ not one spark of ancient fire remain
AABB
tho ’ hostile banners crowd her blazing sky
and stretch 'd in dust her smoking castles lie
yet , lord of all ! from ruin 's blackening ware
thy arm is till omnipotent to save
AABB
“ o never , never more let king be just
be mild in power , or faithful to his trust
let tyrants govern with an iron rod
oppress , destroy , and be the scourge of god
AABB
since he who like a father held his reign
so soon forgot , was just and mild in vain
true , while my friend is grieved , his griefs i share
yet now the rivals are my smallest care
AABB
they for the mighty mischiefs they devise
ere long shall pay — their forfeit lives the price
but against you , ye greeks ! ye coward train
gods ! how my soul is moved with just disdain
AABB
but juno , impotent of rage , replies
“ what hast thou said , o tyrant of the skies
strength and omnipotence invest thy throne
’ tis thine to punish ; ours to grieve alone
AABB
for greece we grieve , abandon ’ d by her fate
to drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate
from fields forbidden we submiss refrain
with arms unaiding see our argives slain
AABB
such sympathies the glorious bard endear
thus fair he walks in man 's diurnal sphere
but when , upborne on bright invention 's wings
he dares the realms of uncreated things
AABB
forms more divine , more dreadful , start to view
than ever hades or olympus knew
round the dark cauldron , terrible and fell
the midnight witches breathe the songs of hell
AABB
delighted ariel wings his fiery way
to whirl the storm , the wheeling orbs to stay
then bathes in honey dews , and sleeps in flowers
meanwhile , young oberon , girt with shadowy powers
AABB
tread softly ! all the earth is holy ground
it may be , could we look with seeing eyes
this spot we stand on is a paradise
where dead have come to life and lost been found
ABBA
where faith has triumphed , martyrdom been crowned
where fools have foiled the wisdom of the wise
from this same spot the dust of saints may rise
and the king 's prisoners come to light unbound
ABBA
this negro singer , come to helicon
constrained the masters , listening to admire
and roused a race to wonder and aspire
gazing which way their honest voice was gone
ABBA
with ebon face uplit of glory 's crest
men marveled at the singer , strong and sweet
who brought the cabin 's mirth , the tuneful night
but faced the morning , beautiful with light
AABB
in vain to deserts thy retreat is made
the muse attends thee to thy silent shade
‘ tis hers the brave man 's latest steps to trace
rejudge his acts , and dignify disgrace
AABB
when interest calls off all her sneaking train
and all the obliged desert , and all the vain
she waits , or to the scaffold , or the cell
when the last lingering friend has bid farewell
AABB
even now she shades thy evening walk with bays
( no hireling she , no prostitute to praise
even now , observant of the parting ray
eyes the calm sunset of thy various day
AABB
he spoke ; when behren 's pass before them lay
and moving nations on the margin stray
thick swarming , venturous ; sail and oar they ply
climb on the surge and o'er the billows fly
AABB
as when autumnal storms awake their force
the storks foreboding tempt their southern course
from all the fields collecting throngs arise
mount on the wing and crowd along the skies
AABB
thus , to his eye , from bleak tartaria 's shore
thro isles and seas , the gathering people pour
change their cold regions for a happier strand
leap from the wave and tread the welcome land
AABB
is it your heart i hear beneath me
or the far tolling of that tower
the voices are still that cried around us
the woods grow still for the sacred hour
ABAB
rise , white lover ! the day draws near
the grey trees lean to the east in fear
‘ by the clear waters where once i died
beloved , whose voice was this that cried
AABB
‘ by the clear waters that reach the sun
by the clear waves that starward run
i found love 's body and lost his soul
and crumbled in flame that should have annealed
AABB
as airy shapes , beneath the moon 's pale eye
people the clouds that sail the midnight sky
dance thro the grove and flit along the glade
and cast their grisly phantoms on the shade
AABB
so move the hordes , in thickets half conceal 'd
or vagrant stalking thro the fenceless field
here tribes untamed , who scorn to fix their home
o'er shadowy streams and trackless deserts roam
AABB
two loves i have , of comfort and despair
that like two spirits do suggest me still
my better angel is a man right fair
my worser spirit a woman colour 'd ill
ABAB
to win me soon to hell , my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her fair pride
ABAB
and whether that my angel be turn 'd fiend
suspect i may , yet not directly tell
for being both to me , both to each friend
i guess one angel in another 's hell
ABAB
stabb ’ d at the sight , deiphobus drew nigh
and made , with force , the vengeful weapon fly
the cretan saw ; and , stooping , caused to glance
from his slope shield the disappointed lance
AABB
beneath the spacious targe , ( a blazing round
thick with bull hides and brazen orbits bound
on his raised arm by two strong braces stay ’ d
he lay collected in defensive shade
AABB
o ’ er his safe head the javelin idly sung
and on the tinkling verge more faintly rung
even then the spear the vigorous arm confess ’ d
and pierced , obliquely , king hypsenor ’ s breast
AABB
o nothing , in this corporal earth of man
that to the imminent heaven of his high soul
responds with colour and with shadow , can
lack correlated greatness . if the scroll
ABAB
where thoughts lie fast in spell of hieroglyph
be mighty through its mighty habitants
if god be in his name ; grave potence if
the sounds unbind of hieratic chants
ABAB
all 's vast that vastness means . nay , i affirm
nature is whole in her least things exprest
nor know we with what scope god builds the worm
our towns are copied fragments from our breast
ABAB
nay , we are children : we will not mature
a blessed gift must seem a theft ; and tears
must storm our eyes when but a joy appears
in drear disguise of sorrow ; and how poor
ABBA
we seem when we are richest ,— most secure
against all poverty the lifelong years
we yet must waste in childish doubts and fears
that , in despite of reason , still endure
ABBA
alas ! the sermon of the rose we will
not wisely ponder ; nor the sobs of grief
lulled into sighs of rapture ; nor the cry
of fierce defiance that again is still
ABBA
in this dark age tho blinded faction sways
and wealth and conquest gain the palm of praise
awed into slaves while groveling millions groan
and blood stain 'd steps lead upward to a throne
AABB
far other wreaths thy virtuous temples twine
far nobler triumphs crown a life like thine
thine be the joys that minds immortal grace
as thine the deeds that bless a kindred race
AABB
now raise thy sorrowed soul to views more bright
the vision 'd ages rushing on thy sight
worlds beyond worlds shall bring to light their stores
time , nature , science blend their utmost powers
AABB
those snary locks are those same nets , my dear
wherewith my liberty thou didst surprise
love was the flame that fir è d me so near
the dart transpiercing were those crystal eyes
ABAB
strong is the net , and fervent is the flame
deep is the wound my sighs can well report
yet i do love , adore , and praise the same
that holds , that burns , that wounds in this sort
ABAB
and list not seek to break , to quench , to heal
the bond , the flame , the wound that festereth so
by knife , by liquor , or by salve to deal
so much i please to perish in my woe
ABAB
this lamb , whose death with life the world hath blest
was from the world 's beginning slain , and he
hath made two wills , which , with the legacy
of his and thy kingdom , thy sons invest
ABBA
yet such are these laws , that men argue yet
whether a man those statutes can fulfil
none doth ; but thy all healing grace and spirit
revive again what law and letter kill
ABAB
cloud topped and splendid , dominating all
the little lesser hills which compass thee
thou standest , bright with april 's buoyancy
yet holding winter in some shaded wall
ABBA
of stern , steep rock ; and startled by the call
of spring , thy trees flush with expectancy
and cast a cloud of crimson , silently
above thy snowy crevices where fall
ABBA
pale shrivelled oak leaves , while the snow beneath
melts at their phantom touch . another year
is quick with import . such each year has been
unmoved thou watchest all , and all bequeath
ABBA
you , meanwhile , where drenched you stand
awaken once more to the rush and roar
and on the rock point tighten your hand
as you turn and see a valley deep
ABAB
that was not there a moment before
suck rattling down between you and a heap
of toppling billow , whose instant fall
must sink the whole island once for all
AABB
or watch the silenter , stealthier seas
feeling their way to you more and more
if they once should clutch you high as the knees
they would whirl you down like a sprig of kelp
ABAB
my lady 's presence makes the roses red
because to see her lips they blush with shame
the lily 's leaves for envy pale became
and her white hands in them this envy bred
ABBA
the marigold the leaves abroad doth spread
because the sun 's and her power is the same
the violet of purple colour came
dyed in the blood she made my heart to shed
ABBA
in brief , all flowers from her their virtue take
from her sweet breath their sweet smells do proceed
the living heat which her eyebeams doth make
warmeth the ground and quickeneth the seed
ABAB
lady of ladies , the delight alone
for which to heaven earth doth no envy bear
seeing and hearing thee , we see and hear
such voice , such light , as never sung nor shone
ABBA
the basest notes which from thy voice proceed
the treble of the angels do exceed
so that i fear their choir to beautify
lest thou to some in heaven shall sing and shine
AABB
keen , fitful gusts are whisp'ring here and there
among the bushes half leafless , and dry
the stars look very cold about the sky
and i have many miles on foot to fare
ABBA
yet feel i little of the cool bleak air
or of the dead leaves rustling drearily
or of those silver lamps that burn on high
or of the distance from home 's pleasant lair
ABBA
“ the two beloved ones left alone , each day
grieved more and more until in peace at last
the bounding line of life was safely past
and all their sorrow then was put away
ABBA
they pined in vain for that dear birdling flown
who , with swift wings had left them there alone
yet oft in gentle tones they spoke of thee
and longed they fair , young face once more to see
AABB
unto our far off shore there sometimes came
faint rumors of thy longed for , new found fame
this gave them joy indeed , yet more of pain
for thus they knew their hopes were all in vain
AABB
o friend ! i know not which way i must look
for comfort , being , as i am , opprest
to think that now our life is only drest
for shew ; mean handywork of craftsman , cook
ABBA
or groom ! we must run glittering like a brook
in the open sunshine , or we are unblest
the wealthiest man among us is the best
no grandeur now in nature or in book
ABBA
delights us . rapine , avarice , expence
this is idolatry ; and these we adore
plain living and high thinking are no more
the homely beauty of the good old cause
ABBA
when garry , who had stanched his wounds , arose
he seized his axe , and ‘ gan with rapid blows
to fell down fir trees . through the silent strath
the hollow echoes rang . with fiendish wrath
AABB
while the sun , sloping to the western sky
proclaimed the closing of that fateful day
but the doomed women little dreamed that they
would have such fearsome end ... as garry lay
AABB
these words were thunder to belphegor 's ears
who instantly took flight , so great his fears
to hell 's abyss he fled without delay
to tell adventures through the realms of day
AABB
sire , said the demon , it is clearly true
damnation does the marriage knot pursue
your highness often hither sees arrive
not squads , but regiments , who , when alive
AABB
by hymen were indissolubly tied
in person i the fact have fully tried
th ’ institution , perhaps , most just could be
past ages far more happiness might see
AABB
i met thee like the morning , though more fair
and hopes ‘ gan travel for a glorious day
and though night met them ere they were aware
leading the joyous pilgrims all astray
ABAB
alaciel 's story 's of another kind
and i 've a little altered it , you 'll find
faults some may see , and others disbelieve
‘ tis all the same :— ‘ twill never make me grieve
AABB
alaciel 's mem'ry , it is very clear
can scarcely by it lose ; there 's naught to fear
two facts important i have kept in view
in which the author fully i pursue
AABB
the one — no less than eight the belle possessed
before a husband 's sight her eyes had blessed
the other is , the prince she was to wed
ne'er seemed to heed this trespass on his bed
AABB
when old jack died , we stayed from school ( they said
at home , we need n't go that day ) , and none
of us ate any breakfast — only one
and that was papa — and his eyes were red
ABBA
when he came round where we were , by the shed
where jack was lying , half way in the sun
and half way in the shade . when we begun
to cry out loud , pa turned and dropped his head
ABBA
and went away ; and mamma , she went back
into the kitchen . then , for a long while
all to ourselves , like , we stood there and cried
we thought so many good things of old jack
ABBA
outwearied with the littleness and spite
the falsehood and the treachery of men
i cried , “ give me but justice ! ” thinking then
i meekly craved a common boon which might
ABBA
most easily be granted ; soon the light
of deeper truth grew on my wondering ken
( escaping baneful damps of stagnant fen
and then i saw that in my pride bedight
ABBA
i claimed from erring man the gift of heaven
god 's own great vested right ; and i grew calm
with folded hands , like stone , to patience given
and pitying , of pure love distilling balm
ABAB
poet of nature , thou hast wept to know
that things depart which never may return
childhood and youth , friendship and love 's first glow
have fled like sweet dreams , leaving thee to mourn
ABAB
these common woes i feel . one loss is mine
which thou too feel'st , yet i alone deplore
thou wert as a lone star , whose light did shine
on some frail bark in winter 's midnight roar
ABAB
and now the board was laid and dressed , and all
sat down to dinner at the baron 's call
and gawayne looked along the room askance
seeking the lady ; and he caught one glance
AABB
of laughing eyes — then looked away in haste
but turned again , and wondered why his taste
had erred so strangely , for the lady seemed
not fairer now than others . had he dreamed
AABB
he rubbed his eyes and pondered ,— though in sooth
without one glimmering presage of the truth
till all passed lightly from his puzzled mind
leaving contentment and good cheer behind
AABB
now swarms the populace : a countless throng
youth and boar age ; and man drives man along
the games begin ; ambitious of the prize
acroneus , thoon , and eretmeus rise
AABB
the prize ocyalus and prymneus claim
anchialus and ponteus , chiefs of fame
there proreus , nautes , eratreus , appear
and famed amphialus , polyneus ’ heir
AABB
euryalus , like mars terrific , rose
when clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes
naubolides with grace unequall 'd shone
or equall 'd by laodamas alone
AABB
seven sweet singing birds up in a tree
seven swift sailing ships white upon the sea
seven bright weather cocks shining in the sun
seven slim race horses ready for a run
AABB
seven golden butterflies flitting overhead
seven red roses blowing in a garden bed
seven white lilies , with honey bees inside them
seven round rainbows , with clouds to divide them
AABB
seven pretty little girls , with sugar on their lips
seven witty little boys , whom everybody tips
seven nice fathers , to call little maids joys
seven nice mothers , to kiss the little boys
AABB
man 's heart may change , but nature 's glory never
strange features throng around me , and the shore
is not my own dear land . yet why deplore
this change of doom ? all mortal ties must sever
ABBA
the pang is past ,— and now with blest endeavour
i check the ready tear , the rising sigh
the common earth is here — the common sky
the common father . and how high soever
ABBA
o'er other tribes proud england 's hosts may seem
god 's children , fair or sable , equal find
a father 's love . then learn , o man , to deem
all difference idle save of heart or mind
ABAB
when younglings first on cupid fix their sight
and see him naked , blindfold , and a boy
though bow and shafts and firebrand be his might
yet ween they he can work them none annoy
ABAB
and therefore with his purple wings they play
for glorious seemeth love though light as feather
and when they have done they ween to scape away
for blind men , say they , shoot they know not whither
ABAB
but when by proof they find that he did see
and that his wound did rather dim their sight
they wonder more how such a lad as he
should be of such surpassing power and might
ABAB
the evening shines in may 's luxuriant pride
and all the sunny hills at distance glow
and all the brooks , that thro ’ the valley flow
seem liquid gold .— o ! had my fate denied
ABBA
leisure , and power to taste the sweets that glide
thro ’ waken 'd minds , as the soft seasons go
on their still varying progress , for the woe
my heart has felt , what balm had been supplied
ABBA
the castle gate stands open now
and the wanderer is welcome to the hall
as the hang bird is to the elm tree bough
no longer scowl the turrets tall
ABAB
the summer 's long siege at last is o'er
when the first poor outcast went in at the door
she entered with him in disguise
and mastered the fortress by surprise
AABB
there is no spot she loves so well on ground
she lingers and smiles there the whole year round
the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land
has hall and bower at his command
AABB
if that a loyal heart and faith unfeigned
if a sweet languish with a chaste desire
if hunger starven thoughts so long retained
fed but with smoke , and cherished but with fire
ABAB
and if a brow with care 's char à cters painted
bewray my love with broken words half spoken
to her which sits in my thoughts ’ temple sainted
and lays to view my vulture gnawn heart open
ABAB
if i have done due homage to her eyes
and had my sighs still tending on her name
if on her love my life and honour lies
and she , th'unkindest maid , still scorns the same
ABAB
good . i have done . my heart weighs . i am sad
the outer day , void statue of lit blue
is altogether outward , other , glad
at mere being not i ( so my aches construe
ABAB
whatever hap or stop , what matters it
sith to the mattering our will bringeth nought
with the higher trifling let us world our wit
conscious that , if we do ’ t , that was the lot
ABAB
nor the swift furie of the flames aspiring
nor the deep wounds of victours raging blade
nor ruthlesse spoyle of souldiers blood desiring
the which so oft thee , rome , their conquest made
ABAB
lady ! the songs of spring were in the grove
while i was framing beds for winter flowers
while i was planting green unfading bowers
and shrubs to hang upon the warm alcove
ABBA
and sheltering wall ; and still , as fancy wove
the dream , to time and nature 's blended powers
i gave this paradise for winter hours
a labyrinth lady ! which your feet shall rove
ABBA
yes ! when the sun of life more feebly shines
becoming thoughts , i trust , of solemn gloom
or of high gladness you shall hither bring
and these perennial bowers and murmuring pines
ABBA
long dwelt his eye where these commingling pour 'd
their waves unkeel 'd , their havens unexplored
where frowning forests stretch the dusky wing
and deadly damps forbid the flowers to spring
AABB
no seasons clothe the field with cultured grain
no buoyant ship attempts the chartless main
then with impatient voice : my seer , he cried
when shall my children cross the lonely tide
AABB
here , here my sons , the hand of culture bring
here teach the lawn to smile , the grove to sing
ye laboring floods , no longer vainly glide
ye harvests load them , and ye forests ride
AABB
o death , a little more , and then the worm
a little longer , o death , a little yet
before the grave gape and the grave worm fret
before the sanguine spotted hand infirm
ABBA
be rottenness , and that foul brain , the germ
of all ill things and thoughts , be stopped and set
a little while , o death , ere he forget
a small space more of life , a little term
ABBA
no ! time , thou shalt not boast that i do change
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel , nothing strange
they are but dressings of a former sight
ABAB
our dates are brief , and therefore we admire
what thou dost foist upon us that is old
and rather make them born to our desire
than think that we before have heard them told
ABAB
thy registers and thee i both defy
not wond'ring at the present , nor the past
for thy records , and what we see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
ABAB
women with child , content ; and old men sleeping
and wet strong ploughlands , scarred for certain grain
and babes that weep , and so forget their weeping
and the young heavens , forgetful after rain
ABAB
and evening hush , broken by homing wings
and song 's nobility , and wisdom holy
that live , we dead . i would think of a thousand things
lovely and durable , and taste them slowly
ABAB
and the king said , “ well , we are stony broke
but the queen could not see it was much of a joke
and she said , “ if the metal is all used up
pray what of the costume i want for the cup
AABB
it all seems so dreadfully simple to me
the stones ? why , import them from over the sea
but a glug stood up with a mole on his chin
and said , with a most diabolical grin
AABB
“ your majesties , down in the country of podge
a spy has discovered a very ‘ cute dodge
and the ogs are determined to wage a war
on gosh , next friday , at half past four
AABB
the quene thanketh the king with al hir might
and after this thus spak she to the knight
whan that she saugh hir tyme , up on a day
‘ thou standest yet , ’ quod she , ‘ in swich array
AABB
because thou hast the power and own'st the grace
to look through and behind this mask of me
( against which , years have beat thus blanchingly
with their rains ,) and behold my soul 's true face
ABBA
the dim and weary witness of life 's race
because thou hast the faith and love to see
through that same soul 's distracting lethargy
the patient angel waiting for a place
ABBA
in the new heavens ,— because nor sin nor woe
nor god 's infliction , nor death 's neighbourhood
nor all which others viewing , turn to go
nor all which makes me tired of all , self viewed
ABAB
forget the past and live the present hour
now is the time to work , the time to fill
the soul with noblest thoughts , the time to will
heroic deeds , to use whatever dower
ABBA
heaven has bestowed , to test our utmost power
now is the time to live , and , better still
to serve our loved ones ; over passing ill
to rise triumphant ; thus the perfect flower
ABBA
of life shall come to fruitage ; wealth amass
for grandest giving ere the time be gone
be glad to day — to morrow may bring tears
be brave to day ; the darkest night will pass
ABBA
no more their snowy flocks shall shepherds lead
by babel 's silver stream and fertile mead
or peasant girls at summer 's eve repair
to wreathe with wilding flowers their flowing hair
AABB
or pour their plaintive ditties to the wave
that rolls its sullen murmurs o'er thy grave
the wandering arab there no rest shall find
but , starting , listen to the hollow wind
AABB
that howls , prophetic , through thy ruined halls
and flee in haste from thy accursed walls
oh babylon , with wrath encompassed round
for thee no hope , no mercy , shall be found
AABB
untouch 'd they stood , till , his long labours o'er
the great ulysses reach 'd his native shore
a double strength of bars secured the gates
fast by the door the wise euryclea waits
AABB
years , months , days , hours , in sighs i sadly spend
i black the night wherein i sleepless toss
i love my griefs yet wish them at an end
thus time 's expense increaseth but my loss
ABAB
i musing stand and wonder at my love
that in so fair should be a heart of steel
and then i think my fancy to remove
but then more painful i my passions feel
ABAB
thus must i love , sweet fair , until i die
and your unkindness doth my love increase
i conquered am , i can it not deny
my life must end , yet shall my love not cease
ABAB
till that a little ant , a silly worme
into his nosthrils creeping , so him pained
that , casting downe his towres , he did deforme
both borrowed pride , and native beautie stained
ABAB
i met a traveller from an antique land
who said : two vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert ... near them , on the sand
half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown
ABAB
and wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command
tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things
the hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed
ABAB
howe'er this fair , amid adventures dire
more sufferings shared than malice could desire
though eight times , doubtless , she exchanged her knight
no proof , that she her spouse was led to slight
AABB
‘ twas gratitude , compassion , or good will
the dread of worse ;— she 'd truly had her fill
excuses just , to vindicate her fame
who , spite of troubles , fanned the monarch 's flame
AABB
of eight the relict , still a maid received
apparently , the prince her pure believed
for , though at times we may be duped in this
yet , after such a number — strange to miss
AABB
first time he kissed me , he but only kissed
the fingers of this hand wherewith i write
and ever since , it grew more clean and white
slow to world greetings , quick with its “ o , list
ABBA
when the angels speak . a ring of amethyst
i could not wear here , plainer to my sight
than that first kiss . the second passed in height
the first , and sought the forehead , and half missed
ABBA
half falling on the hair . o beyond meed
that was the chrism of love , which love 's own crown
with sanctifying sweetness , did precede
the third upon my lips was folded down
ABAB
this dreadful combat great epeus chose
high o ’ er the crowd , enormous bulk ! he rose
and seized the beast , and thus began to say
“ stand forth some man , to bear the bowl away
AABB
( price of his ruin : for who dares deny
this mule my right ; the undoubted victor i
others , ’ tis own ’ d , in fields of battle shine
but the first honours of this fight are mine
AABB
for who excels in all ? then let my foe
draw near , but first his certain fortune know
secure this hand shall his whole frame confound
mash all his bones , and all his body pound
AABB
with that the chief the tender victims slew
and in the dust their bleeding bodies threw
the vital spirit issued at the wound
and left the members quivering on the ground
AABB
from the same urn they drink the mingled wine
and add libations to the powers divine
while thus their prayers united mount the sky
“ hear , mighty jove ! and hear , ye gods on high
AABB
and may their blood , who first the league confound
shed like this wine , disdain the thirsty ground
may all their consorts serve promiscuous lust
and all their lust be scatter ’ d as the dust
AABB
the palmer bent , with locks of silver gray
quits the sweet spot where he has pass 'd his years
quits his poor family , whose anxious fears
paint the loved father fainting on his way
ABBA
and trembling , on his aged limbs slow borne
in these last days that close his earthly course
he , in his soul 's strong purpose , finds new force
though weak with age , though by long travel worn
ABBA
thus reaching rome , led on by pious love
he seeks the image of that saviour lord
whom soon he hopes to meet in bliss above
so , oft in other forms i seek to trace
ABAB
of winter 's spell — away from throng è d press
of urban ways thy wild feet wander far
tracking the steps of some white northern star
whose rays are beacon to thy restlessness
ABBA
weird mystic of the northland 's mystery
thou ‘ front'st the unseen shadow , nor dost fear
to meet the scarlet hunter on the trail
pagan as pan ; to all things sylvan dear
ABAB
the hills more glorious in their coat of snow
rise all around him , in the valleys run
bright streams , and there are lakes that catch the sun
and sunlit fields of emerald far below
ABBA
that seem alive with inward light . in smoke
the far horizons fade ; and there is peace
on everything , a sense of blessed release
from wilful strife . like some prophetic cloak
ABBA
the spirit of the mountains has descended
on all the world , and its unrest is ended
even the sea , glimpsed far away , seems still
hushed to a silver peace its storm and strife
AABB
sometimes we feel so spent for want of rest
we have no thought beyond . i know to day
when tired of bitter lips and dull delay
with faithless words , i cast mine eyes upon
ABBA
the shadows of a distant mountain crest
and said “ that hill must hide within its breast
some secret glen secluded from the sun
oh , mother nature ! would that i could run
AABB
england , i stand on thy imperial ground
not all a stranger ; as thy bugles blow
i feel within my blood old battles flow
the blood whose ancient founts in thee are found
ABBA
still surging dark against the christian bound
wide islam presses ; well its peoples know
thy heights that watch them wandering below
i think how lucknow heard their gathering sound
ABBA
i turn , and meet the cruel , turbaned face
england , ‘ t is sweet to be so much thy son
i feel the conqueror in my blood and race
last night trafalgar awed me , and to day
ABAB
sheath 'd is the river as it glideth by
frost pearl 'd are all the boughs of forests old
the sheep are huddling close upon the wold
and over them the stars tremble on high
ABBA
what kind of heart beats in each dusky case
whiles , startled by the beauty of a face
in a shop light a moment . or instead
to dream of silent fields where calm and deep
AABB
into the golden vessel of great song
let us pour all our passion ; breast to breast
let other lovers lie , in love and rest
not we ,— articulate , so , but with the tongue
ABBA
of all the world : the churning blood , the long
shuddering quiet , the desperate hot palms pressed
sharply together upon the escaping guest
the common soul , unguarded , and grown strong
ABBA
longing alone is singer to the lute
let still on nettles in the open sigh
the minstrel , that in slumber is as mute
as any man , and love be far and high
ABAB
now , now i love indeed , and suffer more
in one day now then i did in a year
great flames they be which but small sparkles were
and wounded now , i was but pricked before
ABBA
no marvel then , though more than heretofore
i weep and sigh ; how can great wounds be there
where moisture runs not out ? and ever , where
the fire is great , of smoke there must be store
ABBA
my heart was hitherto but like green wood
which must be dried before it will burn bright
my former love served but my heart to dry
now cupid for his fire doth find it good
ABBA
like a bad suitor desperate and trembling
from the mixed sense of being not loved and loving
who with feared longing half would know , dissembling
with what he ’ d wish proved what he fears soon proving
ABAB
i look with inner eyes afraid to look
yet perplexed into looking , at the worth
this verse may have and wonder , of my book
to what thoughts shall ’ t in alien hearts give birth
ABAB
but , as he who doth love , and , loving , hopes
yet , hoping , fears , fears to put proof to proof
and in his mind for possible proofs gropes
delaying the true proof , lest the real thing scoff
ABAB
therefore i trust , although to outward sense
both true and false seem shaken ; i will hold
with newer light my reverence for the old
and calmly wait the births of providence
ABBA
no gain is lost ; the clear eyed saints look down
untroubled on the wreck of schemes and creeds
love yet remains , its rosary of good deeds
counting in task field and o'erpeopled town
ABBA
truth has charmed life ; the inward word survives
and , day by day , its revelation brings
faith , hope , and charity , whatsoever things
which cannot be shaken , stand . still holy lives
ABBA
to thee , dear god of mercy , both appeal
who straightway sound the call to arms . thou know'st
and that black spot in each embattled host
spring of the blood stream , later wilt reveal
ABBA
now is it red artillery and white steel
till on a day will ring the victor 's boast
that ‘ tis thy chosen towers uppermost
where thy rejected grovels under heel
ABBA
so in all times of man 's descent insane
to brute , did strength and craft combining strike
even as a god of armies , his fell blow
but at the close he entered thy domain
ABBA
soon as glumdalclitch miss 'd her pleasing care
she wept , she blubber 'd , and she tore her hair
no british miss sincerer grief has known
her squirrel missing , or her sparrow flown
AABB
she furl 'd her sampler , and haul 'd in her thread
and stuck her needle into grildrig 's bed
then spread her hands , and with a bounce let fall
her baby , like the giant in guildhall
AABB
in peals of thunder now she roars , and now
she gently whimpers like a lowing cow
yet lovely in her sorrow still appears
her locks dishevell 'd , and her flood of tears
AABB
when i remember them , those friends of mine
who are no longer here , the noble three
who half my life were more than friends to me
and whose discourse was like a generous wine
ABBA
i most of all remember the divine
something , that shone in them , and made us see
the archetypal man , and what might be
the amplitude of nature 's first design
ABBA
in vain i stretch my hands to clasp their hands
i cannot find them . nothing now is left
but a majestic memory . they meanwhile
wander together in elysian lands
ABBA
to thee that art the sommers nightingale
thy soveraigne goddesses most deare delight
why doe i send this rustick madrigale
that may thy tunefull eare unseason quite
ABAB
to taste the streames , that , like a golden showre
flow from thy fruitfull head , of thy loves praise
fitter perhaps to thunder martiall stowre
when so thee list thy loftie muse to raise
ABAB
the rooks aclamor when one enters here
startle the empty towers far overhead
through gaping walls the summer fields appear
green , tan , or , poppy mingled , tinged with red
ABAB
the courts where revel rang deep grass and moss
cover , and tangled vines have overgrown
the gate where banners blazoned with a cross
rolled forth to toss round tyre and ascalon
ABAB
decay consumes it . the old causes fade
and fretting for the contest many a heart
waits their tyrtaeus to chant on the new
oh , pass him by who , in this haunted shade
ABBA
at times i am the mother of the world
and mine seem all its sorrows , and its fears
that rose , which in each mother heart is curled
the rose of pity , opens with my tears
ABAB
and , waking in the night , i lie and hark
to the lone sobbing , and the wild alarms
of my world child , a wailing in the dark
the child i fain would shelter in my arms
ABAB
i call to it ( as from another room
a mother calls , what time she cannot go
‘ sleep well , dear world ; love hides behind this gloom
there is no need for wakefulness or woe
ABAB
here lie the peril and necessity
that need a race of giants — a great realm
with not one noble leader at the helm
and the great ship of state still driving high
ABBA
‘ midst breakers , on a lee shore — to the rocks
with ever and anon most terrible shocks
the crew aghast , and fear in every eye
yet is the gracious providence still nigh
AABB
and , if our cause be just , our hearts be true
we shall save goodly ship and gallant crew
nor suffer shipwreck of our liberty
it needs that as a people we arise
AABB
this pan is but an idle god , i guess
since all the fair midsummer of my dreams
he loiters listlessly by woody streams
soaking the lush glooms up with laziness
ABBA
or drowsing while the maiden winds caress
him prankishly , and powder him with gleams
of sifted sunshine . and he ever seems
drugged with a joy unutterable — unless
ABBA
his low pipes whistle hints of it far out
across the ripples to the dragon fly
that like a wind born blossom blown about
drops quiveringly down , as though to die
ABAB
o truant muse what shall be thy amends
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends
so dost thou too , and therein dignified
ABAB
make answer muse , wilt thou not haply say
‘ truth needs no colour with his colour fixed
beauty no pencil , beauty 's truth to lay
but best is best , if never intermixed
ABAB
because he needs no praise , wilt thou be dumb
excuse not silence so , for't lies in thee
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
and to be praised of ages yet to be
ABAB
one day , i think , i 'll feel a cool wind blowing
see a slow light across the stygian tide
and hear the dead about me stir , unknowing
and tremble . and i shall know that you have died
ABAB
and watch you , a broad browed and smiling dream
pass , light as ever , through the lightless host
quietly ponder , start , and sway , and gleam
most individual and bewildering ghost
ABAB
is there a man on earth , who , every night
when the day hath exhausted each strong limb
lays him upon his bed in chamber dim
and his heart straightway trembling with delight
ABBA
begins to burn up towards the vaulted height
of the great peace that overshadows him
like flakes of fire his thoughts within him swim
till all his soul is radiant , blazing bright
ABBA
the great earth under him an altar is
upon whose top a sacrifice he lies
burning to god up through the nightly skies
whose love , warm brooding o'er him , kindled his
ABBA
a heavy heart , beloved , have i borne
from year to year until i saw thy face
and sorrow after sorrow took the place
of all those natural joys as lightly worn
ABBA
as the stringed pearls , each lifted in its turn
by a beating heart at dance time . hopes apace
were changed to long despairs , till god 's own grace
could scarcely lift above the world forlorn
ABBA
my heavy heart . then thou didst bid me bring
and let it drop adown thy calmly great
deep being ! fast it sinketh , as a thing
which its own nature does precipitate
ABAB
a little upright , pert , tart , tripping wight
and still his precious self his dear delight
who loves his own smart shadow in the streets
better than e'er the fairest she he meets
AABB
much specious lore , but little understood
( veneering oft outshines the solid wood
his solid sense , by inches you must tell
but mete his cunning by the scottish ell
AABB
this said , to sage piraeus sped the seer
his honour 'd host , a welcome inmate there
o'er the protracted feast the suitors sit
and aim to wound the prince with pointless wit
AABB
cries one , with scornful leer and mimic voice
“ thy charity we praise , but not thy choice
why such profusion of indulgence shown
to this poor , timorous , toil detesting drone
AABB
that others feeds on planetary schemes
and pays his host with hideous noon day dreams
but , prince ! for once at least believe a friend
to some sicilian mart these courtiers send
AABB
mine eye with all the deadly sins is fraught
first proud , sith it presumed to look so high
a watchman being made , stood gazing by
and idle , took no heed till i was caught
ABBA
and envious , bears envy that by thought
should in his absence be to her so nigh
to kill my heart , mine eye let in her eye
and so consent gave to a murder wrought
ABBA
and covetous , it never would remove
from her fair hair , gold so doth please his sight
unchaste , a baud between my heart and love
a glutton eye , with tears drunk every night
ABAB
she loves me ! from her own bliss breathing lips
the live confession came , like rich perfume
from crimson petals bursting into bloom
and still my heart at the remembrance skips
ABBA
like a young lion , and my tongue , too , trips
as drunk with joy ! while every object seen
in life 's diurnal round wears in its mien
a clear assurance that no doubts eclipse
ABBA
and if the common things of nature now
are like old faces flushed with new delight
much more the consciousness of that rich vow
deepens the beauteous , and refines the bright
ABAB
but not the less for lack of wind went she
the flying pinnace , o'er that silent sea
till those dull waters of enchantment lay
behind her many a league . and now her way
AABB
was toward a shining tract of ocean , where
low winds with bland breath flattered the mild air
and low waves did together clasp and close
and skyward yearning from the sea there rose
AABB
friends of the stage ! to whom both players and plays
must sue alike for pardon or for praise
whose judging voice and eye alone direct
the boundless power to cherish or reject
AABB
if e'er frivolity has led to fame
and made us blush that you forbore to blame
if e'er the sinking stage could condescend
to soothe the sickly taste it dare not mend
AABB
all past reproach may present scenes refute
and censure , wisely loud , be justly mute
oh ! since your fiat stamps the drama 's laws
forbear to mock us with misplaced applause
AABB
and thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping
and dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing
and so never ending , but always descending
sounds and motions forever and ever are blending
AABB
then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes
and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he
remembered in what a haughtier guise
he had flung an alms to leprosie
ABAB
“ when he caged his young life up in gilded mail
and set forth in search of the holy grail
the heart within him was ashes and dust
he parted in twain his single crust
AABB
he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink
and gave the leper to eat and drink
‘ t was a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread
‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl
AABB
though thou art now a ruin bare and cold
thou wert sometime the garden of a king
the birds have sought a lovelier place to sing
the flowers are few . it was not so of old
ABBA
it was not thus when hand in hand there strolled
through arbors perfumed with undying spring
bare bodies beautiful , brown , glistening
decked with green plumes and rings of yellow gold
ABBA
do you suppose the herdsman sometimes hears
vague echoes borne beneath the moon 's pale ray
from those old , old , far off , forgotten years
who knows ? here where his ancient kings held sway
ABAB
go , then , and join the murmuring city 's throng
me thou dost leave to solitude and tears
to busy phantasies , and boding fears
lest ill betide thee ; but ‘ twill not be long
ABBA
ere the hard season shall be past ; till then
live happy ; sometimes the forsaken shade
remembering , and these trees now left to fade
nor , ‘ mid the busy scenes and hum of men
ABBA
wilt thou my cares forget : in heaviness
to me the hours shall roll , weary and slow
till mournful autumn past , and all the snow
of winter pale , the glad hour i shall bless
ABBA
the battle quickly raged ; alike they erred
the pirates slaughter loved , and blood preferred
and , long accustomed to the stormy tide
were most expert , and on their skill relied
AABB
in numbers , too , superior they were found
but hisipal 's valour greatly shone around
and kept the combat undecided long
at length grifonio , wond'rous large and strong
AABB
with twenty sturdy , pirates got on board
and many soon lay gasping by the sword
where'er he trod , grim death and horrour reigned
at length , the round the noble hispal gained
AABB
how empty seems the town now you are gone
a wilderness of sad streets , where gaunt walls
hide nothing to desire ; sunshine falls
eery , distorted , as it long had shone
ABBA
on white , dead faces tombed in halls of stone
the whir of motors , stricken through with calls
of playing boys , floats up at intervals
but all these noises blur to one long moan
ABBA
what quest is worth pursuing ? and how strange
that other men still go accustomed ways
i hate their interest in the things they do
a spectre horde repeating without change
ABBA
the castle gate stands open now
and the wanderer is welcome to the hall
as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough
no longer scowl the turrets tall
ABAB
the summer 's long siege at last is o'er
when the first poor outcast went in at the door
she entered with him in disguise
and mastered the fortress by surprise
AABB
there is no spot she loves so well on ground
she lingers and smiles there the whole year round
the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land
has hall and bower at his command
AABB
much sorrow in itself my love doth move
more my despair to love a hopeless bliss
my folly most to love whom sure to miss
o help me , but this last grief to remove
ABBA
so when this thought my sorrow shall augment
that my own folly did procure my pain
then shall i say to give myself content
“ obedience only made me love in vain
ABAB
i sit within my room and joy to find
that thou who always lov'st art with me here
that i am never left by thee behind
but by thyself thou keep'st me ever near
ABAB
the fire burns brighter when with thee i look
and seems a kindlier servant sent to me
with gladder heart i read thy holy book
because thou art the eyes with which i see
ABAB
this aged chair , that table , watch , and door
around in ready service ever wait
nor can i ask of thee a menial more
to fill the measure of my large estate
ABAB
i am part soul part i in all i touch
soul by that part i hold in common with all
and i the spoiled part , that doth make sense such
as i can err by it and my sense mine call
ABAB
the rest is wondering what these thoughts may mean
that come to explain and suddenly are gone
like messengers that mock the message ’ mien
explaining all but the explanation
ABAB
these words were thunder to belphegor 's ears
who instantly took flight , so great his fears
to hell 's abyss he fled without delay
to tell adventures through the realms of day
AABB
sire , said the demon , it is clearly true
damnation does the marriage knot pursue
your highness often hither sees arrive
not squads , but regiments , who , when alive
AABB
by hymen were indissolubly tied
in person i the fact have fully tried
th ’ institution , perhaps , most just could be
past ages far more happiness might see
AABB
æ neas trembling as the phantom flew
started from sleep , and rous 'd the slumb'ring crew
« rise , rise , companions , each one to his oar
710 hoist ev'ry sail — a god sent down once more
AABB
impels our flight — be quick — stand out to sea
the cables cut . great god , whoe'er you be
thy words again exulting we obey
be present , rule our stars — direct our way
AABB
715 propitious ». he spoke , his whirling falchion drew
the halser cut , the bark impatient flew
all felt the impulse — dashing thro ’ the tide
they quit the shore , their barks the ocean hide
AABB
no , fly me , fly me , far as pole from pole
rise alps between us ! and whole oceans roll
ah , come not , write not , think not once of me
nor share one pang of all i felt for thee
AABB
thy oaths i quit , thy memory resign
forget , renounce me , hate whate'er was mine
fair eyes , and tempting looks ( which yet i view
long loved , adored ideas , all adieu
AABB
o grace serene ! o virtue heavenly fair
divine oblivion of low thoughted care
fresh blooming hope , gay daughter of the sky
and faith , our early immortality
AABB
no song nor dance i bring from yon great city
that queens it o'er our taste — the more 's the pity
tho ’ by the bye , abroad why will you roam
good sense and taste are natives here at home
AABB
but not for panegyric i appear
i come to wish you all a good new year
old father time deputes me here before ye
not for to preach , but tell his simple story
AABB
the sage , grave ancient cough 'd , and bade me say
“ you 're one year older this important day
if wiser too — he hinted some suggestion
but ‘ twould be rude , you know , to ask the question
AABB
i dare not move my dim eyes any way
despair behind , and death before , doth cast
such terror , and my feeble flesh doth waste
by sin in it , which it towards hell doth weigh
ABBA
only thou art above , and when towards thee
by thy leave i can look , i rise again
but our old subtle foe so tempteth me
that not one hour myself i can sustain
ABAB
of this worlds theatre in which we stay
my love , like the spectator , ydly sits
beholding me , that all the pageants play
disguysing diversly my troubled wits
ABAB
yet she , beholding me with constant eye
delights not in my merth , nor rues my smart
but when i laugh , she mocks ; and when i cry
she laughs , and hardens evermore her hart
ABAB
but thou , my country , though no fault be thine
for that red horror far across the sea
though not a tortured wretch can point to thee
and curse thee for the selfishness supine
ABBA
of those great powers that cowardly combine
to shield the turk in his iniquity
yet , since thy hand is innocent and free
arise , and show the world the way divine
ABBA
thou canst not break the oppressor 's iron rod
but thou canst help and comfort the oppressed
thou canst not loose the captive 's heavy chain
but thou canst bind his wounds and soothe his pain
AABB
watchword sublime of rome 's imperial sage
tersest of synonyms for self control
paramount precept of the stoic 's age
noblest of mottoes for the lofty soul
ABAB
would thou wert writ in characters of light
at every turn to greet my reverent gaze
and bid me face life 's evils , calm , upright
unspoiled alike by calumny or praise
ABAB
with all our science we are slaves of fate
what is to come we know not , cannot know
grief , suffering , death ,— all touch us soon or late
the master question , how to meet the blow
ABAB
ah ! might i range each hallow 'd bower and glade
mus æ us cultur 'd , many a raptur 'd sigh
wou 'd that dear , local consciousness supply
beneath his willow , in the grotto 's shade
ABBA
whose roof his hand with ores and shells inlaid
how sweet to watch , with reverential eye
thro ’ the sparr 'd arch , the streams he oft survey 'd
thine , blue tham é sis , gently wandering by
ABAB
this is the poet 's triumph , and it towers
o'er life 's pale ills , his consciousness of powers
that lift his memory from oblivion 's gloom
secure a train of these heart thrilling hours
AABB
yet , yet forgive me , oh ye sacred few
whom late by delaware 's green banks i knew
whom , known and loved through many a social eve
‘ twas bliss to live with , and ‘ twas pain to leave
AABB
not with more joy the lonely exile scanned
the writing traced upon the desert 's sand
where his lone heart but little hoped to find
one trace of life , one stamp of human kind
AABB
than did i hail the pure , the enlightened zeal
the strength to reason and the warmth to feel
the manly polish and the illumined taste
which ,— mid the melancholy , heartless waste
AABB
i view that oak , the fancied glades among
by which as milton lay , his evening ear
from many a cloud that dropped ethereal dew
nigh sphered in heaven , its native strains could hear
ABAB
on which that ancient trump he reached was hung
thither oft , his glory greeting
from waller 's myrtle shades retreating
with many a vow from hope 's aspiring tongue
ABBA
my trembling feet his guiding steps pursue
in vain — such bliss to one alone
of all the sons of soul was known
and heaven and fancy , kindred powers
ABBA
“ god bless the darling eva ! ” was my prayer
a pure , unconscious depth of earnestness
was in her eyes , so indescribable
you might as well the color of the air
ABBA
why should i more molest the world with cries
the air with sighs , the earth below with tears
since i live hateful to those ruthful eyes
vexing with untuned moan her dainty ears
ABAB
if i have loved her dearer than my breath
my breath that calls the heaven to witness it
and still hold her most dear until my death
and if that all this cannot move one whit
ABAB
by holy motives led , and not chagrin
the hermit never spoke of what he 'd seen
but , from the youth 's discernment , strove to hide
whate'er regarded love , and much beside
AABB
the softer sex , with all their magick charms
that fill the feeling bosom with alarms
as years advanced , the boy with care he taught
what suited best his age before him brought
AABB
at five he showed him animals and flow'rs
the birds of air , the beasts , their sev'ral pow'rs
and now and then of hell he gave a hint
old satan 's wrath , and what might awe imprint
AABB
sudden his forehead he lifted high
a faint sound strayed like a moth wing by
like beacons his eyes burst blazing forth
a dust cloud he spied in the distant north
AABB
a noise and a smoke on the plain afar
‘ tis the cloud and the clang of the moslem war
he leapt aloft like a tiger snared
the wine in his veins through his visage flared
AABB
he tore at his fetters in bootless ire
he called the prophet , he named his sire
from his lips , with wild shout , the techir burst
he danced in his irons ; the giaours he cursed
AABB
“ hear , all ye hosts , and hear , unnumber ’ d bands
of neighbouring nations , or of distant lands
’ twas not for state we summon ’ d you so far
to boast our numbers , and the pomp of war
AABB
ye came to fight ; a valiant foe to chase
to save our present , and our future race
tor this , our wealth , our products , you enjoy
and glean the relics of exhausted troy
AABB
now then , to conquer or to die prepare
to die or conquer are the terms of war
whatever hand shall win patroclus slain
whoe ’ er shall drag him to the trojan train
AABB
fair is my love , and cruel as she 's fair
her brow shades frowns although her eyes are sunny
her smiles are lightning though her pride despair
and her disdains are gall , her favours honey
ABAB
a modest maid , decked with a blush of honour
whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love
the wonder of all eyes that look upon her
sacred on earth , designed a saint above
ABAB
chastity and beauty , which were deadly foes
live reconcil è d friends within her brow
and had she pity to conjoin with those
then who had heard the plaints i utter now
ABAB
land of our fathers , in thine hour of need
god help thee , guarded by the passive creed
as the lone pilgrim trusts to beads and cowl
when through the forest rings the gray wolf 's howl
AABB
as the deep galleon trusts her gilded prow
when the black corsair slants athwart her bow
as the poor pheasant , with his peaceful mien
trusts to his feathers , shining golden green
AABB
when the dark plumage with the crimson beak
has rustled shadowy from its splintered peak
so trust thy friends , whose babbling tongues would charm
the lifted sabre from thy foeman 's arm
AABB
tumultuous rushing o'er the outstretched plains
a wildered maze of comets and of suns
the blood of changeless god that ever runs
with quick diastole up the immortal veins
ABBA
a phantom host that moves and works in chains
a monstrous fiction , which , collapsing , stuns
the mind to stupor and amaze at once
a tragedy which that man best explains
ABBA
run , shepherds , run where bethlehem blest appears
we bring the best of news ; be not dismayed
a saviour there is born more old than years
amidst heaven 's rolling height this earth who stayed
ABAB
in a poor cottage inned , a virgin maid
a weakling did him bear , who all upbears
there is he poorly swaddled , in manger laid
to whom too narrow swaddlings are our spheres
ABAB
run , shepherds , run , and solemnize his birth
this is that night — no , day , grown great with bliss
in which the power of satan broken is
in heaven be glory , peace unto the earth
ABBA
i wish sometimes , although a worthless thing
spurred by ambition , glad to aspire
myself a monarch , or some mighty king
and then my thoughts do wish for to be higher
ABAB
but when i view what winds the cedars toss
what storms men feels that covet for renown
i blame myself that i have wished my loss
and scorn a kingdom , though it give a crown
ABAB
ah licia , though the wonder of my thought
my heart 's content , procurer of my bliss
for whom a crown i do esteem as naught
as asia 's wealth , too mean to buy a kiss
ABAB
if this were true , england indeed were dead
if the wild fashion of that poisonous hour
wherein the new salome , clothed with power
wriggled and hissed , with hands and feet so red
ABBA
should even now demand that glorious head
whose every word was like an english flower
whose every song an english april shower
whose every thought immortal wine and bread
ABBA
if this were true , if england should prefer
darkness , corruption , and the adulterous crew
shakespeare and browning would cry shame on her
and milton would deny the land he knew
ABAB
he that goes back does , since he goes , advance
though he doth not advance who goeth back
and he that seeks , though he on nothing chance
may still by words be said to find a lack
ABAB
this paradox of having , that is nought
in the world ’ s meaning of the things it screens
is yet true of the substance of pure thought
and there means something by the nought it means
ABAB
oh , yes ! they love through all this world of ours
i will not gainsay love , called love forsooth
i have heard love talked in my early youth
and since , not so long back but that the flowers
ABBA
then gathered , smell still . mussulmans and giaours
throw kerchiefs at a smile , and have no ruth
for any weeping . polypheme 's white tooth
slips on the nut if , after frequent showers
ABBA
the shell is over smooth ,— and not so much
will turn the thing called love , aside to hate
or else to oblivion . but thou art not such
a lover , my beloved ! thou canst wait
ABAB
when i have seen by time 's fell hand defaced
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see down rased
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
ABAB
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss , and loss with store
ABAB
when i have seen such interchange of state
or state it self confounded , to decay
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
that time will come and take my love away
ABAB
she gave up beauty in her tender youth
gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways
she covered up her eyes lest they should gaze
on vanity , and chose the bitter truth
ABBA
harsh towards herself , towards others full of ruth
servant of servants , little known to praise
long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days
she schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth
ABBA
that with the poor and stricken she might make
a home , until the least of all sufficed
her wants ; her own self learned she to forsake
counting all earthly gain but hurt and loss
ABAB
i had withdrawn in forest , and my song
was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway
and to the forest edge you came one day
( this was my dream ) and looked and pondered long
ABBA
but did not enter , though the wish was strong
you shook your pensive head as who should say
‘ i dare not — too far in his footsteps stray
he must seek me would he undo the wrong
ABBA
not far , but near , i stood and saw it all
behind low boughs the trees let down outside
and the sweet pang it cost me not to call
and tell you that i saw does still abide
ABAB
and rested at the foot of those wild hills
the rugged founts of the peraean rills
and of that other ridge whose barren back
stretches , with all its mist and cloudy rack
AABB
south westward to cleone . there she stood
about a young bird 's flutter from a wood
fair , on a sloping green of mossy tread
by a clear pool , wherein she passioned
AABB
thou comest ! all is said without a word
i sit beneath thy looks , as children do
in the noon sun , with souls that tremble through
their happy eyelids from an unaverred
ABBA
yet prodigal inward joy . behold , i erred
in that last doubt ! and yet i cannot rue
the sin most , but the occasion — that we two
should for a moment stand unministered
ABBA
by a mutual presence . ah , keep near and close
thou dove like help ! and when my fears would rise
with thy broad heart serenely interpose
brood down with thy divine sufficiencies
ABAB
‘ tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
when not to be , receives reproach of being
and the just pleasure lost , which is so deemed
not by our feeling , but by others ’ seeing
ABAB
for why should others ’ false adulterate eyes
give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies
which in their wills count bad what i think good
ABAB
no , i am that i am , and they that level
at my abuses , reckon up their own
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel
by their rank thoughts , my deeds must not be shown
ABAB
pride of the sister realm so long our own
we claim with her that spotless fame of thine
white as her snow and fragrant as her pine
ours was thy birthplace , but in every zone
ABBA
some wreath of song thy liberal hand has thrown
breathes perfume from its blossoms , that entwine
where'er the dewdrops fall , the sunbeams shine
on life 's long path with tangled cares o'ergrown
ABBA
can art thy truthful counterfeit command
the silver haloed features , tranquil , mild
soften the lips of bronze as when they smiled
give warmth and pressure to the marble hand
ABBA
immortal singer , in whose glorious brain
unearthly melodies were born to make
a nocturn for the blessed master 's sake
i see thee pass through heaven 's gates again
ABBA
i hear thee singing that majestic strain
which soothed the heart affliction could not break
and proved the faith no worldly ills could shake
and then i see thee join god 's holy train
ABBA
but , wonder of all wonders ! where the light
breaks from a thousand suns , the seraphs , shod
with flaming sandals , lead thee ; and my sight
dims with the vision , till fresh from his rod
ABAB
terror , his best beloved son , attends his course
arm ’ d with stern boldness , and enormous force
the pride of haughty warriors to confound
and lay the strength of tyrants on the ground
AABB
from thrace they fly , call ’ d to the dire alarms
of warring phlegyans , and ephyrian arms
invoked by both , relentless they dispose
to these glad conquest , murderous rout to those
AABB
the stainless soul that smiled through glorious eyes
the bright grave brow whereon dark fortune 's blast
might blow , but might not bend it , nor o'ercast
save for one fierce fleet hour of shame , the skies
ABBA
thrilled with warm dreams of worthier days to rise
and end the whole world 's winter ; here at last
if death be death , have passed into the past
if death be life , live , though their semblance dies
ABBA
hope and high faith inviolate of distrust
shone strong as life inviolate of the grave
through each bright word and lineament serene
most loving righteousness and love most just
ABBA
the lady has agreed , you will remark
that in a room where ev'ry part is dark
( perhaps to ‘ scape the keeper 's prying sight
or shame directs exclusion of the light
AABB
she will receive your gay inconstant spouse
now , take her place ; the case deceit allows
make jack your friend ; nor haggle at the price
a hundred ducats give , is my advice
AABB
he 'll place you in the room where darkness reigns
think not too fast , nor suffer heavy chains
do what you wish , and utter not a word
to speak , assuredly would be absurd
AABB
i know myself . not servile for applause
my muse permits no deprecating clause
modest or vain , she will not be denied
one bold confession due to honest pride
AABB
and well she knows the drooping veil of song
shall save her boldness from the caviller 's wrong
her sweeter voice the heavenly maid imparts
to tell the secrets of our aching hearts
AABB
for this , a suppliant , captive , prostrate , bound
she kneels imploring at the feet of sound
for this , convulsed in thought 's maternal pains
she loads her arms with rhyme 's resounding chains
AABB
with sense of wrong and outrage desperate
strode on and thundered at the palace gate
rushed through the courtyard , thrusting in his rage
to right and left each seneschal and page
AABB
and hurried up the broad and sounding stair
his white face ghastly in the torches ’ glare
from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed
voices and cries he heard , but did not heed
AABB
henry ! i greet thine entrance into life
sure presage that the myrmidons of fate
the fool 's unmeaning laugh , the critic 's hate
will dire assail thee ; and the envious strife
ABBA
of bookish schoolmen , beings over rife
whose pia mater studious is fill 'd
with unconnected matter , half distill 'd
from letter 'd page , shall bare for thee the knife
ABBA
beneath whose edge the poet ofttimes sinks
but fear not ! for thy modest work contains
the germ of worth ; thy wild poetic strains
how sweet to him , untutor 'd bard , who thinks
ABBA
these empty accents mingled with the wind
nor moved great jove ’ s unalterable mind
to godlike hector and his matchless might
was owed the glory of the destined fight
AABB
like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried
and all the gates sustain ’ d an equal tide
through the long walls the stony showers were heard
the blaze of flames , the flash of arms appear ’ d
AABB
whence came it that i knew in others ’ case
how bitter sweet and tyrant slave is love
how quick to jealous doubt it yieldeth place
if mine own self did ne'er his power prove
ABAB
whence knew i the deep sense that in the soul
is thrill 'd and thrall 'd by perfect beauty 's sight
if never beauty did myself control
with all the mastery of sovran might
ABAB
when springing from the earth like the sweet lark
that wings its flight in music to the sky
amid the spheres it wanders , where the eye
trembles to blindness , and the last faint spark
ABBA
of earth 's far gleaming flickers and expires
thine is the charm , dear poesy , which sets
the cag ë d spirit on its heavenward flight
and fills its being with those pure desires
ABBA
heralds at arms do three perfections quote
to wit , most fair , most rich , most glittering
so when those three concur within one thing
needs must that thing of honour be a note
ABBA
lately i did behold a rich fair coat
which wish è d fortune to mine eyes did bring
a lordly coat , yet worthy of a king
in which one might all these perfections note
ABBA
a field of lilies , roses proper bare
two stars in chief ; the crest was waves of gold
how glittering ‘ twas , might by the stars appear
the lilies made it fair for to behold
ABAB
but while this softer art their bliss supplies
it gives their follies also room to rise
for praise , too dearly loved or warmly sought
enfeebles all internal strength of thought
AABB
and the weak soul , within itself unblessed
leans for all pleasure on another 's breast
hence ostentation here , with tawdry art
pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart
AABB
here vanity assumes her pert grimace
and trims her robes of frieze with copper lace
here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer
to boast one splendid banquet once a year
AABB
greece , conquered greece , her conqueror subdued
and rome grew polished , who till then was rude
the rough saturnian measure had its day
and gentler arts made savagery give way
AABB
yet traces of the uncouth past lived on
for many a year , nor are they wholly gone
for ‘ twas not till the punic wars were o'er
that rome found time greek authors to explore
AABB
and try , by digging in that virgin field
what sophocles and aeschylus could yield
nay , she essayed a venture of her own
and liked to think she 'd caught the tragic tone
AABB
fair sun , if you would have me praise your light
when night approacheth wherefore do you fly
time is so short , beauties so many be
as i have need to see them day and night
ABBA
that by continual view my verses might
tell all the beams of your divinity
which praise to you and joy should be to me
you living by my verse , i by your sight
ABBA
i by your sight , and not you by my verse
need mortal skill immortal praise rehearse
no , no , though eyes were blind , and verse were dumb
your beauty should be seen and your fame known
AABB
dearly i bought that was so slightly rated
even with the price of blood and body 's wasting
she would not yield that ought might be abated
for all she saw my love was pure and lasting
ABAB
what guyle is this , that those her golden tresses
she doth attyre under a net of gold
and with sly skill so cunningly them dresses
that which is gold or haire may scarse be told
ABAB
is it that mens frayle eyes , which gaze too bold
she may entangle in that golden snare
and , being caught , may craftily enfold
their weaker harts , which are not wel aware
ABAB
take heed therefore , myne eyes , how ye doe stare
henceforth too rashly on that guilefull net
in which if ever ye entrapped are
out of her bands ye by no meanes shall get
ABAB
then asmiel touched his hand and broke the thread
of fine spun thought , and very gently said
“ the one of whom thou thinkest bids thee go
alone to spiran 's huts , across the snow
AABB
to serve him there . ” with sorrow and surprise
malvin looked up , reluctance in his eyes
the broken thought , the strangeness of the call
the perilous passage of the mountain wall
AABB
the solitary journey , and the length
of ways unknown , too great for his frail strength
appalled him . with a doubtful brow
he scanned the doubtful task , and muttered , “ how
AABB
we live by faith ; but faith is not the slave
of text and legend . reason 's voice and god 's
nature 's and duty 's , never are at odds
what asks our father of his children , save
ABBA
justice and mercy and humility
a reasonable service of good deeds
pure living , tenderness to human needs
reverence and trust , and prayer for light to see
ABBA
the master 's footprints in our daily ways
no knotted scourge nor sacrificial knife
but the calm beauty of an ordered life
whose very breathing is unworded praise
ABBA
“ say thou , whose praises all our host proclaim
thou living glory of the grecian name
say whence these coursers ? by what chance bestow ’ d
the spoil of foes , or present of a god
AABB
not those fair steeds , so radiant and so gay
that draw the burning chariot of the day
old as i am , to age i scorn to yield
and daily mingle in the martial field
AABB
but sure till now no coursers struck my sight
like these , conspicuous through the ranks of fight
some god , i deem , conferred the glorious prize
bless ’ d as ye are , and favourites of the skies
AABB
he 's called the general from the brazen craft
and dash with which he sneaks a bit of road
and all its fares ; challenged , or chafed , or chaffed
back answers of the newest he 'll explode
ABAB
he reins his horses with an air ; he treats
with scoffing calm whatever powers there be
he gets it straight , puts a bit on , and meets
his losses with both lip and pounds s. d
ABAB
he arrogates a special taste in short
is loftily grateful for a flagrant smoke
at all the smarter housemaids winks his court
and taps them for half crowns ; being stoney broke
ABAB
frost views his brilliant foe with scornful eye
and whirls a tenfold tempest thro the sky
where each fine atom of the immense of air
steel 'd , pointed , barb 'd for unexampled war
AABB
sings o'er the shuddering ground ; when thus he broke
contemptuous silence , and to hesper spoke
thou comest in time to share their last disgrace
to change to crystal with thy rebel race
AABB
stretch thy huge corse o'er delaware 's bank afar
and learn the force of elemental war
or if undying life thy lamp inspire
take that one blast and to thy sky retire
AABB
“ love me , for i love you ” — and answer me
“ love me , for i love you ” — so shall we stand
as happy equals in the flowering land
of love , that knows not a dividing sea
ABBA
love builds the house on rock and not on sand
love laughs what while the winds rave desperately
and who hath found love 's citadel unmanned
and who hath held in bonds love 's liberty
ABAB
my heart 's a coward though my words are brave
we meet so seldom , yet we surely part
so often ; there 's a problem for your art
still i find comfort in his book , who saith
ABBA
wert thou but shown to win us to admire
and veil in death thy splendour ?— but unknown
their destination who least time have shone
and brightest beamed .— when these the eternal sire
ABBA
— righteous , and wise , and good are all his ways
eclipses as their sun begins to rise
can mortal judge , for their diminish 'd days
what blest equivalent in changeless skies
ABAB
they knelt in silent anguish by her bed
and could not weep ; but calmly there she lay
all pain had left her ; and the sun 's last ray
shone through upon her , warming into red
ABBA
the shady curtains . in her heart she said
‘ heaven opens ; i leave these and go away
the bridegroom calls ,— shall the bride seek to stay
then low upon her breast she bowed her head
ABBA
o lily flower , o gem of priceless worth
o dove with patient voice and patient eyes
o fruitful vine amid a land of dearth
o maid replete with loving purities
ABAB
full happy is the man who comes at last
into the safe completion of his year
weathered the perils of his spring , that blast
how many blossoms promising and dear
ABAB
and of his summer , with dread passions fraught
that oft , like fire through the ripening corn
blight all with mocking death and leave distraught
loved ones to mourn the ruined waste forlorn
ABAB
but now , though autumn gave but harvest slight
oh , grateful is he to the powers above
for winter 's sunshine , and the lengthened night
by hearth side genial with the warmth of love
ABAB
though night hath climbed her peak of highest noon
and bitter blasts the screaming autumn whirl
all night through archways of the bridg è d pearl
and portals of pure silver walks the moon
ABBA
wake on , my soul , nor crouch to agony
turn cloud to light , and bitterness to joy
and dross to gold with glorious alchemy
basing thy throne above the world 's annoy
ABAB
reign thou above the storms of sorrow and ruth
that roar beneath ; unshaken peace hath won thee
so shall thou pierce the woven glooms of truth
so shall the blessing of the meek be on thee
ABAB
and now farewel , when i shal fare but ill
flourish & ioy , wh [= e ] i shal droope and languish
all plentious good awaite vpon thy will
wh [= e ] extreame want shal bring my soule deaths anguish
ABAB
so , nowe adiew ; the winds call my depart
thy beauties excellence , my rudest quill
shall neuer more vnto the world impart
so that it know thy hate , i haue my will
ABAB
beyond the sphere which spreads to widest space
now soars the sigh that my heart sends above
a new perception born of grieving love
guideth it upward the untrodden ways
ABBA
when it hath reached unto the end and stays
it sees a lady round whom splendors move
in homage ; till , by the great light thereof
abashed , the pilgrim spirit stands at gaze
ABBA
yet the sweet simple , by misordered use
death or some dangerous sickness may produce
should we not for our sustentation eat
because a surfeit comes from too much meat
AABB
so our fair plant — that doth as needful stand
as heaven , or fire , or air , or sea , or land
as moon , or stars that rule the gloomy night
or sacred friendship , or the sunny light
AABB
her treasured virtue in herself enrolls
and leaves the evil to vainglorious souls
and yet , who dies with this celestial breath
shall live immortal in a joyful death
AABB
woe for the ‘ witching look of that fair face
the port where ease with dignity combined
woe for those accents ’ that each savage mind
to softness tuned , to noblest thoughts the base
ABBA
and the sweet smile , from whence the dart i trace
which now leaves death my only hope behind
exalted soul , most fit on thrones to ‘ ve shined
but that too late she came this earth to grace
ABBA
for you i still must burn , and breathe in you
for i was ever yours ; of you bereft
full little now i reck all other care
with hope and with desire you thrill 'd me through
ABBA
even thus , quoth she , the warlike god embrac 'd me
and then she clipp 'd adonis in her arms
even thus , quoth she , the warlike god unlaced me
as if the boy should use like loving charms
ABAB
even thus , quoth she , he seized on my lips
and with her lips on his did act the seizure
and as she fetched breath , away he skips
and would not take her meaning nor her pleasure
ABAB
endearing waltz ! to thy more melting tune
bow irish jig and ancient rigadoon
scotch reels , avaunt ! and country dance forego
your future claims to each fantastic toe
AABB
waltz , waltz alone , both legs and arms demands
liberal of feet , and lavish of her hands
hands which may freely range in public sight
where ne'er before — but — pray “ put out the light
AABB
methinks the glare of yonder chandelier
shines much too far , or i am much too near
and true , though strange , waltz whispers this remark
“ my slippery steps are safest in the dark
AABB
who had to name admetus : long ago
the dwellers by the lake have ceased to know
his name , because the world grows old , but then
he was accounted great among great men
AABB
young , strong , and godlike , lacking nought at all
of gifts that unto royal men might fall
in those old simple days , before men went
to gather unseen harm and discontent
AABB
“ all seeing monarch ! whether lycia ’ s coast
or sacred ilion , thy bright presence boast
powerful alike to ease the wretch ’ s smart
o hear me ! god of every healing art
AABB
lo ! stiff with clotted blood , and pierced with pain
that thrills my arm , and shoots through every vein
i stand unable to sustain the spear
and sigh , at distance from the glorious war
AABB
low in the dust is great sarpedon laid
nor jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid
but thou , o god of health ! thy succour lend
to guard the relics of my slaughter ’ d friend
AABB
when i am standing on a mountain crest
or hold the tiller in the dashing spray
my love of you leaps foaming in my breast
shouts with the winds and sweeps to their foray
ABAB
my heart bounds with the horses of the sea
and plunges in the wild ride of the night
flaunts in the teeth of tempest the large glee
that rides out fate and welcomes gods to fight
ABAB
ho , love , i laugh aloud for love of you
glad that our love is fellow to rough weather
no fretful orchid hothoused from the dew
but hale and hardy as the highland heather
ABAB
by floods , that , thundering from their dizzy height
swell more gigantic on the stedfast sight
black drizzling crags , that beaten by the din
vibrate , as if a voice complained within
AABB
bare steeps , where desolation stalks afraid
unstedfast , by a blasted yew unstayed
by cells whose image , trembling as he prays
awe struck , the kneeling peasant scarce surveys
AABB
loose hanging rocks the day 's bless 'd eye that hide
and crosses reared to death on every side
which with cold kiss devotion planted near
and bending water 'd with the human tear
AABB
“ go first the master of thy herds to find
true to his charge , a loyal swain and kind
for thee he sighs ; and to the loyal heir
and chaste penelope extends his care
AABB
at the coracian rock he now resides
where arethusa 's sable water glides
the sable water and the copious mast
swell the fat herd ; luxuriant , large repast
AABB
with him rest peaceful in the rural cell
and all you ask his faithful tongue shall tell
me into other realms my cares convey
to sparta , still with female beauty gay
AABB
i know that all beneath the moon decays
and what by mortals in this world is brought
in time 's great periods shall return to nought
that fairest states have fatal nights and days
ABBA
i know that all the muse 's heavenly lays
with toil of sp'rit , which are so dearly bought
as idle sounds , of few , or none , are sought
that there is nothing lighter than vain praise
ABBA
i know frail beauty like the purple flower
to which one morn oft birth and death affords
that love a jarring is of minds ’ accords
where sense and will envassal reason 's power
ABBA
ethna , to cull sweet flowers divinely fair
to seek for gems of such transparent light
as would not be unworthy to unite
round thy fair brow , and through thy dark brown hair
ABBA
i would that i had wings to cleave the air
in search of some far region of delight
that back to thee from that adventurous flight
a glorious wreath my happy hands might bear
ABBA
soon would the sweetest persian rose be thine
soon would the glory of golconda 's mine
flash on thy forehead , like a star — ah ! me
in place of these , i bring , with trembling hand
AABB
and after further compliment and talk
among the asters in the garden walk
he left his guests ; and to his cottage turned
and as he entered for a moment yearned
AABB
for the lost splendors of the days of old
the ruby glass , the silver and the gold
and felt how piercing is the sting of pride
by want embittered and intensified
AABB
he looked about him for some means or way
to keep this unexpected holiday
searched every cupboard , and then searched again
summoned the maid , who came , but came in vain
AABB
now , o'er the earth a solemn stillness ran
and lull 'd alike the cares of brute and man
save where the dardan leaders , nightly , hold
alternate converse , and their plans unfold
AABB
on one great point the council are agreed
an instant message to their prince decreed
each lean 'd upon the lance he well could wield
and pois 'd with easy arm his ancient shield
AABB
when nisus and his friend their leave request
to offer something to their high behest
with anxious tremors , yet unaw 'd by fear , [ v
the faithful pair before the throne appear
AABB
i purposed once to take my pen and write
not songs , like some , tormented and awry
with passion , but a cunning harmony
of words and music caught from glen and height
ABBA
and lucid colours born of woodland light
and shining places where the sea streams lie
but this was when the heat of youth glowed white
and since i 've put the faded purpose by
ABAB
i have no faultless fruits to offer you
who read this book ; but certain syllables
herein are borrowed from unfooted dells
and secret hollows dear to noontide dew
ABBA
through whose green boughs the golden sunshine creeps
where merlin by the enchanted thorn tree sleeps
for here he came with the fay vivian
one april , when the warm days first began
AABB
he was on foot , and that false fay , his friend
on her white palfrey ; here he met his end
in these lone sylvan glades , that april day
this tale of merlin and the lovely fay
AABB
dear unborn children , to our mother 's trust
we leave you , fearless , when we lie in dust
while o'er these walls the christian banner waves
from hallowed lips shall flow the truth that saves
AABB
while o'er those portals veritas you read
no church shall bind you with its human creed
take from the past the best its toil has won
but learn betimes its slavish ruts to shun
AABB
pass the old tree whose withered leaves are shed
quit the old paths that error loved to tread
and a new wreath of living blossoms seek
a narrower pathway up a loftier peak
AABB
what shapes are these and shadows without end
that fill the night full as a storm of rain
with myriads of dead men and women slain
old with young , child with mother , friend with friend
ABBA
that on the deep mid wintering air impend
pale yet with mortal wrath and human pain
who died that this man dead now too might reign
toward whom their hands point and their faces bend
ABBA
the ruining flood would redden earth and air
if for each soul whose guiltless blood was shed
there fell but one drop on this one man 's head
whose soul to night stands bodiless and bare
ABBA
thine incarnation was upon this wise
saviour ; and out of east and west were led
to thy foul cradle by thy planet red
shepherds of souls that feed their sheep with lies
ABBA
till the utter soul die as the body dies
and the wise men that ask but to be fed
though the hot shambles be their board and bed
and sleep on any dunghill shut their eyes
ABBA
so they lie warm and fatten in the mire
and the high priest enthroned yet in thy name
judas , baptised thee with men 's blood for hire
and now thou hangest nailed to thine own shame
ABAB
we , like the leaf , the summit , or the wave
reflect the light our common nature gave
but every sunbeam , falling from her throne
wears on our hearts some coloring of our own
AABB
chilled in the slave , and burning in the free
like the sealed cavern by the sparkling sea
lost , like the lightning in the sullen clod
or shedding radiance , like the smiles of god
AABB
pure , pale in virtue , as the star above
or quivering roseate on the leaves of love
glaring like noontide , where it glows upon
ambition 's sands ,— the desert in the sun
AABB
my mistress ’ eyes are nothing like the sun
coral is far more red , than her lips red
if snow be white , why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires , black wires grow on her head
ABAB
i have seen roses damasked , red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
ABAB
i love to hear her speak , yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
ABAB
far yonder , where orchards and gardens lie
and dwellings cluster , ‘ tis there men die
they are born , they die , and are buried near
where the populous graveyard lightens the bier
AABB
for strict and close are the ties that bind
in death the children of human kind
yea , stricter and closer than those of life
‘ tis a neighborhood that knows no strife
AABB
they are noiselessly gathered — friend and foe
to the still and dark assemblies below
without a frown or a smile they meet
each pale and calm in his winding sheet
AABB
when tedious much and over weary long
cruel disdain reflecting from her brow
hath been the cause that i endured such wrong
and rest thus discontent and weary now
ABAB
yet when posterity in time to come
shall find th ’ uncancelled tenour of her vow
and her disdain be then confessed of some
how much unkind and long , i find it now
ABAB
o yet even then — though then will be too late
to comfort me ; dead , many a day , ere then
they shall confess i did not force her heart
and time shall make it known to other men
ABAB
a golden column next in rank appear 'd
on which a shrine of purest gold was rear 'd
finish 'd the whole , and labour 'd every part
with patient touches of unwearied art
AABB
the mantuan there in sober triumph sate
composed his posture , and his look sedate
on homer still he fix 'd a reverend eye
great without pride , in modest majesty
AABB
in living sculpture on the sides were spread
the latian wars , and haughty turnus dead
eliza stretch 'd upon the funeral pyre
aeneas bending with his aged sire
AABB
not that i love thy children , whose dull eyes
see nothing save their own unlovely woe
whose minds know nothing , nothing care to know
but that the roar of thy democracies
ABBA
xi . and so thou neededst not our human skill
to fix what thus were transient — there it grew
wedded to thy perfection ; and anew
with every coming vision rose there still
ABBA
some living principle which did fulfil
thy most legitimate manhood ; and unto
thy soul all nature rendered up its due
with not a contradiction ; and each hill
ABBA
how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse
thine own sweet argument , too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
ABAB
o give thy self the thanks if aught in me
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
for who 's so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thy self dost give invention light
ABAB
around the rocky headlands , far and near
the wakened ocean murmured with dull tongue
till all the coast 's mysterious caverns rung
with the waves ’ voice , barbaric , hoarse , and drear
ABBA
within this distant valley , with rapt ear
i listened , thrilled , as though a spirit sung
or some gray god , as when the world was young
moaned to his fellow , mad with rage or fear
ABBA
thus in the dark , ere the first dawn , methought
the sea 's deep roar and sullen surge and shock
broke the long silence of eternity
and echoed from the summits where god wrought
ABBA
the husband ev'ry way was armed so well
he four such men as andrew could repel
in quest of succour howsoe'er he went
to kill him surely william never meant
AABB
but only take an ear , or what the turks
those savage beasts , cut off from nature 's works
which doubtless must be infinitely worse
infernal practice and continual curse
AABB
‘ twas this he whispered should be andrew 's doom
when with his easy wife he left the room
she nothing durst reply : the door he shut
and our gallant ‘ gan presently to strut
AABB
look , how the flower which ling'ringly doth fade
the morning 's darling late , the summer 's queen
spoil 'd of that juice which kept it fresh and green
as high as it did raise , bows low the head
ABBA
right so the pleasures of my life being dead
or in their contraries but only seen
with swifter speed declines than erst it spread
and , blasted , scarce now shows what it hath been
ABAB
as doth the pilgrim , therefore , whom the night
by darkness would imprison on his way
think on thy home , my soul , and think aright
of what 's yet left thee of life 's wasting day
ABAB
the earth renewed presents a glorious scene
mountains and valleys of perpetual green
delicious plains , and odoriferous bowers
unfading forests , never dying flowers
AABB
fruits that on fragrant trees immortal grow
rivers that murmur sweetly as they flow
and gardens decked with everlasting spring
and shining warblers on the tireless wing
AABB
no howling tempest breaks the sweet repose
no piercing thorn surrounds the blushing rose
no sultry heat parches those blooming plains
no night is known where day forever reigns
AABB
when midnight comes a host of dogs and men
go out and track the badger to his den
and put a sack within the hole , and lie
till the old grunting badger passes bye
AABB
he comes and hears — they let the strongest loose
the old fox hears the noise and drops the goose
the poacher shoots and hurries from the cry
and the old hare half wounded buzzes bye
AABB
they get a forked stick to bear him down
and clap the dogs and take him to the town
and bait him all the day with many dogs
and laugh and shout and fright the scampering hogs
AABB
“ ‘ are you alive , o goddess born ? ’ she said
‘ or if a ghost , then where is hector 's shade
at this , she cast a loud and frightful cry
with broken words i made this brief reply
AABB
‘ all of me that remains appears in sight
i live , if living be to loathe the light
no phantom ; but i drag a wretched life
my fate resembling that of hector 's wife
AABB
what have you suffer 'd since you lost your lord
by what strange blessing are you now restor 'd
still are you hector 's ? or is hector fled
and his remembrance lost in pyrrhus ’ bed
AABB
the fair hair 'd boy is at his mother 's knee
a many colour 'd page before them spread
gay summer harvest field of gold and red
with lines and staves of ancient minstrelsy
ABBA
but through her eyes alone the child can see
from her sweet lips partake the words of song
and looks as one who feels a hidden wrong
or gazes on some feat of gramarye
ABBA
‘ when thou canst use it , thine the book ! ’ she cried
he blush 'd , and clasp 'd it to his breast with pride
‘ unkingly task ! ’ his comrades cry ; in vain
all work ennobles nobleness , all art
AABB
then , first aroused in that appointed hour
the tragic muse confess 'd th ’ inspiring power
sudden before the startled earth she stood
a giant spectre , weeping tears and blood
AABB
guilt shrunk appall 'd , despair embraced his shroud
and terror shriek 'd , and pity sobb 'd aloud
then , first thalia with dilated ken
and quicken 'd footstep pierced the walks of men
AABB
then folly blush 'd , vice fled the general hiss
delight met reason with a loving kiss
at satire 's glance pride smooth 'd his low'ring crest
the graces weaved the dance .— and last and best
AABB
the morn was wasted in the pathless grass
and long and lonesome was the wild to pass
but when the southern sun had warm 'd the day
a youth came posting o'er a crossing way
AABB
his raiment decent , his complexion fair
and soft in graceful ringlets waved his hair
then near approaching , ‘ father , hail ! ’ he cried
‘ and hail , my son ! ’ the reverend sire replied
AABB
words follow 'd words , from question answer flow 'd
and talk of various kind deceived the road
till each with other pleased , and loth to part
while in their age they differ , join in heart
AABB
my cares draw on mine everlasting night
in horror 's sable clouds sets my life 's sun
my life 's sweet sun , my dearest comfort 's light
shall rise no more to me whose day is done
ABAB
i 'll go before unto the myrtle shades
t'attend the presence of my world 's dear
and there prepare her flowers that never fades
and all things fit against her coming there
ABAB
if any ask me why so soon i came
i 'll hide her sin and say it was my lot
in life and death i 'll tender her good name
my life nor death shall never be her blot
ABAB
he hurries to his tent ;— oh rage ! despair
no glimpse , no tidings of the frantic fair
save that some carmen , as acamp they drove
had seen her coursing for the western grove
AABB
faint with fatigue and choked with burning thirst
forth from his friends with bounding leap he burst
vaults o'er the palisade with eyes on flame
and fills the welkin with lucinda 's name
AABB
swift thro the wild wood paths phrenetic springs
lucind ! lucinda ! thro the wild wood rings
all night he wanders ; barking wolves alone
and screaming night birds answer to his moan
AABB
ser federigo thought not of the chase
the tender vision of her lovely face
i will not say he seems to see , he sees
in the leaf shadows of the trellises
AABB
herself , yet not herself ; a lovely child
with flowing tresses , and eyes wide and wild
coming undaunted up the garden walk
and looking not at him , but at the hawk
AABB
“ beautiful falcon ! ” said he , “ would that i
might hold thee on my wrist , or see thee fly
the voice was hers , and made strange echoes start
through all the haunted chambers of his heart
AABB
nothing sweet boy , but yet like prayers divine
i must each day say o'er the very same
counting no old thing old , thou mine , i thine
even as when first i hallowed thy fair name
ABAB
so that eternal love in love 's fresh case
weighs not the dust and injury of age
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
but makes antiquity for aye his page
ABAB
o poet 's city ! one who scarce has seen
some twenty summers cast their doublets green
for autumn 's livery , would seek in vain
to wake his lyre to sing a louder strain
AABB
or tell thy days of glory ;— poor indeed
is the low murmur of the shepherd 's reed
where the loud clarion 's blast should shake the sky
and flame across the heavens ! and to try
AABB
such lofty themes were folly : yet i know
that never felt my heart a nobler glow
than when i woke the silence of thy street
with clamorous trampling of my horse 's feet
AABB
the dewy roseate morn had with her hairs
in sundry sorts the indian clime adorned
and now her eyes apparrel è d in tears
the loss of lovely memnon long had mourned
ABAB
when as she spied the nymph whom i admire
combing her locks , of which the yellow gold
made blush the beauties of her curl è d wire
which heaven itself with wonder might behold
ABAB
then red with shame , her reverend locks she rent
and weeping hid the beauty of her face
the flower of fancy wrought such discontent
the sighs which midst the air she breathed a space
ABAB
a hurry of hoofs in a village street
a shape in the moonlight , a bulk in the dark
and beneath , from the pebbles , in passing , a spark
struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet
ABBA
that was all ! and yet , through the gloom and the light
the fate of a nation was riding that night
and the spark struck out by that steed , in his flight
kindled the land into flame with its heat
AABB
he has left the village and mounted the steep
and beneath him , tranquil and broad and deep
is the mystic , meeting the ocean tides
and under the alders , that skirt its edge
AABB
well , if a king 's a lion , at the least
the people are a many headed beast
can they direct what measures to pursue
who know themselves so little what to do
AABB
alike in nothing but one lust of gold
just half the land would buy , and half be sold
their country 's wealth our mightier misers drain
or cross , to plunder provinces , the main
AABB
the rest , some farm the poor box , some the pews
some keep assemblies , and would keep the stews
some with fat bucks on childless dotards fawn
some win rich widows by their chine and brawn
AABB
say , whence , obedient , to their destin 'd end
the various tribes of living nature tend
why beast , and bird , and all the countless race
of earth and waters , each his proper place
AABB
instinctive knows , and through the endless chain
of being moves in one harmonious strain
while man alone , with strange perversion , draws
rebellious fame from nature 's broken laws
AABB
methinks i hear , in that still voice which stole
on horeb 's mount o'er rapt elijah 's soul
with stern reproof indignant heaven reply
‘ tis o'erweening pride , that blinds the eye
AABB
who framed the stanza of childe harold ? he
it was who , halting on a stormy shore
knew well the lofty voice which evermore
in grand distress , doth haunt the sleepless sea
ABBA
with solemn sounds . and as each wave did roll
till one came up , the mightiest of the whole
to sweep and surge across the vacant lea
wild words were wedded to wild melody
AABB
this poet must have had a speechless sense
of some dead summer 's boundless affluence
else , whither can we trace the passioned lore
of beauty , steeping to the very core
AABB
she came in with the twilight noiselessly
fair as a rose , immaculate as truth
she leaned above my wrecked and wasted youth
i felt her presence , which i could not see
ABBA
“ god keep you , my poor friend , ” i heard her say
and then she kissed my dry , hot lips and eyes
kiss thou the next kiss , quiet death , i pray
be instant on this hour , and so surprise
ABAB
the bold ormenian and asterian bands
in forty barks eurypylus commands
where titan hides his hoary head in snow
and where hyperia ’ s silver fountains flow
AABB
thy troops , argissa , polypoetes leads
and eleon , shelter ’ d by olympus ’ shades
gyrtone ’ s warriors ; and where orthe lies
and oloosson ’ s chalky cliffs arise
AABB
sprung from pirithous of immortal race
the fruit of fair hippodame ’ s embrace
( that day , when hurl ’ d from pelion ’ s cloudy head
to distant dens the shaggy centaurs fled
AABB
prais 'd be the poet , who the sonnet 's claim
severest of the orders that belong
distinct and separate to the delphic song
shall venerate , nor its appropriate name
ABBA
lawless assume . peculiar is its frame
from him deriv 'd , who shunn 'd the city throng
and warbled sweet thy rocks and streams among
lonely valclusa !— and that heir of fame
ABBA
our greater milton , hath , by many a lay
form 'd on that arduous model , fully shown
that english verse may happily display
those strict energic measures , which alone
ABAB
to me fair friend you never can be old
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still : three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers ’ pride
ABAB
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
in process of the seasons have i seen
three april perfumes in three hot junes burned
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ABAB
ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
steal from his figure , and no pace perceived
so your sweet hue , which methinks still doth stand
hath motion , and mine eye may be deceived
ABAB
he is afraid , seeing her lie so still
so utterly his own ; afraid lest she
should open wide her eyes and let him see
the passionate conquest of her virgin will
ABBA
shine there in triumph , starry bright with tears
he thrusts her from him : face and hair and breast
hands he had touched , lips that his lips had pressed
seem things deadly to be desired . he fears
ABBA
lest she should body forth in palpable shame
those dreams and longings that his blood , aflame
through the hot dark of summer nights , had dreamed
and longed . must all his love , then , turn to this
AABB
these hearts were woven of human joys and cares
washed marvellously with sorrow , swift to mirth
the years had given them kindness . dawn was theirs
and sunset , and the colours of the earth
ABAB
these had seen movement and heard music ; known
slumber and waking ; loved ; gone proudly friended
felt the quick stir of wonder ; sat alone
touched flowers and furs and cheeks . all this is ended
ABAB
there are waters blown by changing winds to laughter
and lit by the rich skies , all day . and after
frost , with a gesture , stays the waves that dance
and wandering loveliness . he leaves a white
AABB
we ask that love shall rise to the divine
and yet we crave him very human , too
our hearts would drain the crimson of his wine
our souls despise him if he prove untrue
ABAB
poor love ! i hardly see what you can do
we know all human things are weak and frail
and yet we claim that very part of you
then , inconsistent , blame you if you fail
ABAB
when you would soar , ‘ t is we who clip your wings
although we weep because you faint and fall
alas ! it seems we want so many things
that no dear love could ever grant them all
ABAB
speak thou , whose thoughts at humble peace repine
shall wolsey 's wealth , with wolsey 's end , be thine
or liv'st thou now , with safer pride content
the wisest justice on the banks of trent
AABB
for why did wolsey , near the steeps of fate
on weak foundations raise the enormous weight
why but to sink beneath misfortune 's blow
with louder ruin , to the gulphs below
AABB
what gave great villiers to the assassin 's knife
and fix 'd disease on harley 's closing life
what murder 'd wentworth , and what exiled hyde
by kings protected , and to kings allied
AABB
i see in vision the warm lighted hall
the living and the dead i see again
and but my chair is empty ; ‘ mid them all
‘ tis i that seem the dead : they all remain
ABAB
immortal , changeless creatures of the brain
wellnigh i doubt which world is real most
of sense or spirit to the truly sane
in this abstraction it were light to deem
ABAB
the husband ev'ry way was armed so well

these , o ’ er the bending ocean , helen ’ s cause
in sixty ships with menelaus draws
eager and loud from man to man he flies
revenge and fury flaming in his eyes
AABB
great wrong i doe , i can it not deny
to that most sacred empresse , my dear dred
not finishing her queene of fa ë ry
that mote enlarge her living prayses , dead
ABAB
but lodwick *, this of grace to me aread
do ye not thinck th'accomplishment of it
sufficient worke for one mans simple head
all were it , as the rest , but rudely writ
ABAB
how then should i , without another wit
thinck ever to endure so tedious toyle
sith that this one is tost with troublous fit
of a proud love , that doth my spirite spoyle
ABAB
when she comes home again ! a thousand ways
i fashion , to myself , the tenderness
of my glad welcome : i shall tremble — yes
and touch her , as when first in the old days
ABBA
i touched her girlish hand , nor dared upraise
mine eyes , such was my faint heart 's sweet distress
then silence : and the perfume of her dress
the room will sway a little , and a haze
ABBA
cloy eyesight — soulsight , even — for a space
and tears — yes ; and the ache here in the throat
to know that i so ill deserve the place
her arms make for me ; and the sobbing note
ABAB
great master ! teach us how to hope in man
we lift our eyes upon his works and ways
and disappointment chills us as we gaze
our dream of him so far the truth outran
ABBA
so far his deeds are ever falling short
and then we fold our graceful hands and say
“ the world is vulgar . ” didst thou turn away
o sacred spirit , delicately wrought
ABBA
your love and pity doth th ’ impression fill
which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow
for what care i who calls me well or ill
so you o'erhyppphengreen my bad , my good allow
ABAB
you are my all the world , and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
none else to me , nor i to none alive
that my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
ABAB
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others ’ voices , that my adder 's sense
to critic and to flatterer stopped are
mark how with my neglect i do dispense
ABAB
the twins worked the wheel an ’ huldy steered
an ’ pinkie clung tight — she was awfully skeered
they got back home at half past six
but , oh ! they got into a nawful fix
AABB
for just as they sunk the house gave a lurch
an ’ they landed right on top of a church
an ’ they punched a hole through the roof with the steeple
to the great amazement of all of the people
AABB
an ’ the toys fell out of that house in the air
an ’ all the children in the town was there
so every one got a present again
‘ cept willie an ’ wallie an ’ huldy an ’ jane
AABB
my love for thee doth march like armed men
against a queenly city they would take
along the army 's front its banners shake
across the mountain and the sun smit plain
ABBA
it steadfast sweeps as sweeps the steadfast rain
and now the trumpet makes the still air quake
and now the thundering cannon doth awake
echo on echo , echoing loud again
ABBA
but , lo ! the conquest higher than bard e'er sung
instead of answering cannon , proud surrender
joyful the iron gates are open flung
and , for the conqueror , welcome gay and tender
ABAB
hadst thou been such as , boasting of their birth
pass by the humbler born with proud disdain
making self merit of the antique worth
whereby some sire that state for them did gain
ABAB
had riches ’ dross so reign 'd in thy respect
that riches ’ lack were deem 'd by thee disgrace
of thy rare parts had ‘ t been the rude effect
that cruel pride held gentle pity 's place
ABAB
then would'st thou ne'er have look 'd on lowly me
to find what merit there thou might'st approve
nor would my heart , grown warm for haughty thee
dare or desire to clamour for thy love
ABAB
a black and glassy float , opaque and still
the loch , at furthest ebb supine in sleep
reversing , mirrored in its luminous deep
the calm grey skies ; the solemn spurs of hill
ABBA
heather , and corn , and wisps of loitering haze
the wee white cots , black hatted , plumed with smoke
the braes beyond — and when the ripple awoke
they wavered with the jarred and wavering glaze
ABBA
there is a race which cold , ungenial skies
breed from decay , as fungous growths arise
though dying fast , yet springing fast again
which still usurps an unsubstantial reign
AABB
with frames too languid for the charms of sense
and minds worn down with action too intense
tired of a world whose joys they never knew
themselves deceived , yet thinking all untrue
AABB
scarce men without , and less than girls within
sick of their life before its cares begin
the dull disease , which drains their feeble hearts
to life 's decay some hectic thrill 's imparts
AABB
mysterious nothing ! how shall i define
thy shapeless , baseless , placeless emptiness
nor form , nor colour , sound , nor size is thine
nor words nor fingers can thy voice express
ABAB
but though we cannot thee to aught compare
a thousand things to thee may likened be
and though thou art with nobody nowhere
yet half mankind devote themselves to thee
ABAB
how many books thy history contain
how many heads thy mighty plans pursue
what labouring hands thy portion only gain
what busy bodies thy doings only do
ABAB
a child of brighter than the morning 's birth
and lovelier than all smiles that may be smiled
save only of little children undefiled
sweet , perfect , witless of their own dear worth
ABBA
live rose of love , mute melody of mirth
glad as a bird is when the woods are mild
adorable as is nothing save a child
hails with wide eyes and lips his life on earth
ABBA
his lovely life with all its heaven to be
and whoso reads the name inscribed or hears
feels his own heart a frozen well of tears
child , for deep dread and fearful pity of thee
ABBA
another that with prudence , and with cares
has mannag 'd well his family affairs
govern 'd his wife and children with that ease
which always kept the family in peace
AABB
his sons and daughters educated so
none better bred , none cou 'd gentiler go
the sons are now set up to drive their trade
the daughters married , and their fortunes paid
AABB
one son runs out , another takes ill ways
for which their father 's pocket always pays
the daughter 's husband breaks , and she must come
and live a burthen on him again at home
AABB
` what wol now every lover seyn of thee
if this be wist , but ever in thyn absence

ABAB
“ vain boaster ! cease , and know the powers divine
jove ’ s and apollo ’ s is this deed , not thine

AABB
had twenty mortals , each thy match in might
opposed me fairly , they had sunk in fight
by fate and phoebus was i first o ’ erthrown
euphorbus next ; the third mean part thy own
AABB
but thou , imperious ! hear my latest breath
the gods inspire it , and it sounds thy death
insulting man , thou shalt be soon as i
black fate o ’ erhangs thee , and thy hour draws nigh
AABB
once more into my arid days like dew
like wind from an oasis , or the sound
of cold sweet water bubbling underground
a treacherous messenger , the thought of you
ABBA
comes to destroy me ; once more i renew
firm faith in your abundance , whom i found
long since to be but just one other mound
of sand , whereon no green thing ever grew
ABBA
and once again , and wiser in no wise
i chase your colored phantom on the air
and sob and curse and fall and weep and rise
and stumble pitifully on to where
ABAB
“ what words are these , and what imprudence thine
( thus interposed the martial maid divine
forgetful youth ! but know , the power above
with ease can save each object of his love
AABB
wide as his will , extends his boundless grace
nor lost in time nor circumscribed by place
happier his lot , who , many sorrows ’ pass 'd
long labouring gains his natal shore at last
AABB
than who , too speedy , hastes to end his life
by some stern ruffian , or adulterous wife
death only is the lot which none can miss
and all is possible to heaven but this
AABB
i like her gentle hand that sometimes strays
to find the place , through the same book with mine
i like her feet ; and o , those eyes divine
and when we say farewell , perhaps she stays
ABBA
love lingering — then hurries on her ways
as if she thought , “ to end my pain and thine
i like her voice better than new made wine
i like the mandolin whereon she plays
ABBA
and i like , too , the cloak i saw her wear
and the red scarf that her white neck doth cover
and well i like the door that she comes through
i like the ribbon that doth bind her hair
ABBA
among the folks , to whom he visits paid
was neighbour peter , one who used the spade
a villager that god , in lieu of lands
had furnished only with a pair of hands
AABB
to dig and delve , and by the mattock gain
enough his wife and children to maintain
still youthful charms you in his spouse might trace
the weather injured solely had her face
AABB
but not the features which were perfect yet
some wish perhaps more blooming belles to get
the rustick truly me would ne'er have pleased
but such are oft by country parsons seized
AABB
o solitude ! if i must with thee dwell
let it not be among the jumbled heap
of murky buildings ; climb with me the steep
nature 's observatory — whence the dell
ABBA
its flowery slopes , its river 's crystal swell
may seem a span ; let me thy vigils keep
‘ mongst boughs pavillion 'd , where the deer 's swift leap
startles the wild bee from the fox glove bell
ABBA
but though i 'll gladly trace these scenes with thee
yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind
whose words are images of thoughts refin 'd
is my soul 's pleasure ; and it sure must be
ABBA
sybil of months , and worshipper of winds
i love thee , rude and boisterous as thou art
and scraps of joy my wandering ever finds
mid thy uproarious madness — when the start
ABAB
of sudden tempests stirs the forest leaves
into hoarse fury , till the shower set free
stills the huge swells . then ebb the mighty heaves
that sway the forest like a troubled sea
ABAB
i love thy wizard noise , and rave in turn
half vacant thoughts and rhymes of careless form
then hide me from the shower , a short sojourn
neath ivied oak ; and mutter to the storm
ABAB
in english ale their dear enjoyment lies
for which they starve themselves and families
an englishman will fairly drink as much
as will maintain two families of dutch
AABB
subjecting all their labours to the pots
the greatest artists are the greatest sots
the country poor do by example live
the gentry lead them , and the clergy drive
AABB
what may we not from such examples hope
the landlord is their god , the priest their pope
a drunken clergy , and a swearing bench
has given the reformation such a drench
AABB
‘ tis a cruel creed , believe it not
death to the good is a milder lot
they are here ,— they are here ,— that harmless pair
in the yellow sunshine and flowing air
AABB
in the light cloud shadows that slowly pass
in the sounds that rise from the murmuring grass
they sit where their humble cottage stood
they walk by the waving edge of the wood
AABB
and list to the long accustomed flow
of the brook that wets the rocks below
patient , and peaceful , and passionless
as seasons on seasons swiftly press
AABB
the winds breathe low , the element serene
yet mark what motion in the waves is seen
thronging and busy as hyblaean swarms
or straggled soldiers summon 'd to their arms
AABB
see where the princely bark in loosest pride
with all her guardian fleet , adorns the tide
high on her deck the royal lovers stand
our crimes to pardon , e'er they touch 'd our land
AABB
sweet warriour ! when shall i have peace with you
high time it is this warre now ended were
which i no lenger can endure to sue
ne your incessant battry more to beare
ABAB
yet shoot ye sharpely still , and spare me not
but glory thinke to make these cruel stoures
ye cruell one ! what glory can be got
in slaying him that would live gladly yours
ABAB
lifelong our stumbles , lifelong our regret
lifelong our efforts failing and renewed
while lifelong is our witness , “ god is good
who bore with us till now , bears with us yet
ABBA
who still remembers and will not forget
who gives us light and warmth and daily food
and gracious promises half understood
and glories half unveiled , whereon to set
ABBA
our heart of hearts and eyes of our desire
uplifting us to longing and to love
luring us upward from this world of mire
urging us to press on and mount above
ABAB
here , where we stood together , we three men
before the war had swept us to the east
three thousand miles away , i stand again
and bear the bells , and breathe , and go to feast
ABAB
we trod the same path , to the selfsame place
yet here i stand , having beheld their graves
skyros whose shadows the great seas erase
and seddul bahr that ever more blood craves
ABAB
so , since we communed here , our bones have been
nearer , perhaps , than they again will be
earth and the worldwide battle lie between
death lies between , and friend destroying sea
ABAB
dull in the night , when the camps were still
thumped two nags over good hope hill
the white deserter , the passing spy
took to the brush as the pair went by
AABB
the army mule gave over the chase
the catholic negro , hearing the pace
said , as they splashed through oxon run
“ dey ride like de soldiers who speared god 's son
AABB
but when good friday 's bells behind
died in the capital on the wind
he who rode foremost paused to say
“ herold , spur up to my side , scared boy
AABB
let us forget . what matters it that we
once reigned o'er happy realms of long ago
and talked of love , and let our voices low
and ruled for some brief sessions royally
ABBA
what if we sung , or laughed , or wept maybe
it has availed not anything , and so
let it go by that we may better know
how poor a thing is lost to you and me
ABBA
but yesterday i kissed your lips , and yet
did thrill you not enough to shake the dew
from your drenched lids — and missed , with no regret
your kiss shot back , with sharp breaths failing you
ABAB
she , by her neighbour , was received , we 're told
‘ mid costly furniture and burnished gold
we may suppose what splendour shone around
when all attracting he would fain be found
AABB
the best of wines ; each dish considered rare
the gods themselves received not better fare
till then , alaciel ne'er had tasted wine
her faith forbade a liquor so divine
AABB
and , unacquainted with the potent juice
she much indulged at table in its use
if lately love disquieted her brain
new poison now pervaded ev'ry vein
AABB
their daughter , jane , was in her twentieth year
and did to him a lovely maid appeal
he knew her soon as skilled in house affairs
but ever lacking vain , coquettish airs
AABB
her form was graceful , and of medium size
and sweet good nature beamed in her bright eyes
her face , for most part , wore a pleasant smile
while her dear heart ne'er harbored aught of guile
AABB
her charms were such that cooper 's heart , ere long
could not resist their influence so strong
nor need we wonder much , for soon he learned
she had good offers , in great plenty , spurned
AABB
alas ‘ tis true , i have gone here and there
and made my self a motley to the view
gored mine own thoughts , sold cheap what is most dear
made old offences of affections new
ABAB
most true it is , that i have looked on truth
askance and strangely : but by all above
these blenches gave my heart another youth
and worse essays proved thee my best of love
ABAB
now all is done , have what shall have no end
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof , to try an older friend
a god in love , to whom i am confined
ABAB
think not alone to do right , and fulfill
life 's due perfection by the simple worth
of lawful actions called by justice forth
and thus condone a world confused with ill
ABBA
but fix the high condition of thy will
to be right , that its good 's spontaneous birth
may spread like flowers springing from the earth
on which the natural dews of heaven distill
ABBA
for these require no honors , take no care
for gratitude from men — but more are blessed
in the sweet ignorance that they are fair
and through their proper functions live and rest
ABAB
i griev 'd for buonaparte , with a vain
and an unthinking grief ! the vital blood
of that man 's mind what can it be ? what food
fed his first hopes ? what knowledge could he gain
ABBA
‘ tis not in battles that from youth we train
the governor who must be wise and good
and temper with the sternness of the brain
thoughts motherly , and meek as womanhood
ABAB
wisdom doth live with children round her knees
books , leisure , perfect freedom , and the talk
man holds with week day man in the hourly walk
of the mind 's business : these are the degrees
ABBA
yon starry vault that round him rolls the spheres
and gives to earth her seasons , days and years
the source designates and the clue imparts
of all his errors and of all his arts
AABB
there spreads the system that his ardent thought
first into emblems , then to spirits wrought
spirits that ruled all matter and all mind
nourish 'd or famish 'd , kill 'd or cured mankind
AABB
bade him neglect the soil whereon he fed
work with hard hand for that which was not bread
erect the temple , darken deep the shrine
yield the full hecatomb with awe divine
AABB
the wild tide of battle runs red ,— dashes high
and blots out the splendour of earth and of sky
the blue air is heavy , and sulph'rous , and dun
and the breeze on its wings bears the boom of the gun
AABB
in faster and fiercer and deadlier shocks
the thunderous billows are hurled on the rocks
and our valley becomes , amid spring 's softest breath
the valley , alas ! of the shadow of death
AABB
the crash of the onset ,— the plunge and the roll
reach down to the depth of each patriot 's soul
it quivers — for since it is human , it must
but never a tremor of doubt or distrust
AABB
untill he came unto the broken tree
and to the spring that late devoured was
what say i more ? each thing at last we see
doth passe away : the phoenix there , alas
ABAB
remark what crowds his name around him brings
schools , synods , prelates , potentates and kings
all gaining knowledge from his boundless store
and join 'd to shield him from the papal power
AABB
first of his friends , see frederic 's princely form
ward from the sage divine the gathering storm
in learned wittemburgh secure his seat
high throne of thought , religion 's safe retreat
AABB
there sits melancthon , mild as morning light
and feuds , tho sacred , soften in his sight
in terms so gentle flows his tuneful tongue
even cloister 'd bigots join the pupil throng
AABB
who says drum major says a man of mould
shaking the meek earth with tremendous tread
and pacing still , a triumph to behold
of his own spine at least two yards ahead
ABAB
attorney , grocer , surgeon , broker , duke
his calling may be anything , who comes
into a room , his presence a rebuke
to the dejected , as the pipes and drums
ABAB
inspired his port !— who mounts his office stairs
as though he led great armies to the fight
his bulk itself 's pure genius , and he wears
his avoirdupois with so much fire and spright
ABAB
poor rod'rick now no other hope had got
than what the chance of traffick might allot
illusion vain , or doubtful at the best
though some grow rich , yet all are not so blessed
AABB
‘ twas said our husband never would succeed
and truly , such it seemed to be decreed
his agents ( similar to those we see
in modern days ) were with his treasure free
AABB
his ships were wrecked ; his commerce came to naught
deceived by knaves , of whom he well had thought
obliged to borrow money , which to pay
he was unable at th ’ appointed day
AABB
partakes our cheerful meals , partaking first
in mutual labour and in mutual thirst
the kindly intercourse will ever prove
a bond of amity and social love
AABB
to more than man this generous warmth extends
and oft the team and shiv'ring herd befriends
tender solicitude the bosom fills
and pity executes what reason wills
AABB
now gentle sleep hath closed up those eyes
which , waking , kept my boldest thoughts in awe
and free access unto that sweet lip lies
from which i long the rosy breath to draw
ABAB
methinks no wrong it were , if i should steal
from those two melting rubies one poor kiss
none sees the theft that would the thief reveal
nor rob i her of aught that she can miss
ABAB
nay , should i twenty kisses take away
there would be little sign i had done so
why then should i this robbery delay
o , she may wake , and therewith angry grow
ABAB
till in thy streets the bearded goth was seen
and now upon thy walls the breezes fan
( ah , city crowned by god , discrowned by man
the hated flag of red and white and green
ABBA
when was thy glory ! when in search for power
thine eagles flew to greet the double sun
and the wild nations shuddered at thy rod
nay , but thy glory tarried for this hour
ABBA
so long your reign , said richard , o'er my mind
deny i could not , howsoe'er inclined
with mrs. simon often is your spouse
her character no doubt your spleen will rouse
AABB
i 've no design , observe to give offence
but , when i see your int'rest in suspense
i cannot silent keep ; though , were i still
a slave , devoted wholly to your will
AABB
as late i moved , i would not drop a word
mistrust of lovers may not be absurd
besides , you 'd fancy other motives led
to tell you of your husband what was said
AABB
there is a bondage worse , far worse , to bear
than his who breathes , by roof , and floor , and wall
pent in , a tyrant 's solitary thrall
‘ tis his who walks about in the open air
ABBA
one of a nation who , henceforth , must wear
their fetters in their souls . for who could be
who , even the best , in such condition , free
from self reproach , reproach that
ABBA
with human nature ? never be it ours
to see the sun how brightly it will shine
and know that noble feelings , manly powers
instead of gathering strength , must droop and pine
ABAB
“ oft , when the world imagine women stray
the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way
through all the giddy circle they pursue
and old impertinence expel by new
AABB
what tender maid but must a victim fall
to one man 's treat , but for another 's ball
when florio speaks what virgin could withstand
if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand
AABB
with varying vanities , from every part
they shift the moving toyshop of their heart
where wigs with wigs , with sword knots sword knots strive
beaux banish beaux , and coaches coaches drive
AABB
the countess turned her face to the yerl
it was true what was said by the dying girl
it was sir peregrine 's horn they heard
and they both sat mute , nor whispered a word
AABB
for they wondered much , and were sore afraid
of mysteries working about the maid
who , as she lay in her ecstasie
kept muttering slow an ave marie
AABB
this nature , this great flood of life , this cheat
that uses us as baubles for her coat
takes love , that should be nothing but the beat
of blood for its own beauty , by the throat
ABAB
saying , you are my servant and shall do
my purposes , or utter bitterness
shall be your wage , and nothing come to you
but stammering tongues that never can confess
ABAB
undaunted then in answer here i cry
‘ you wanton , that control the hand of him
who masquerades as wisdom in a sky
where holy , holy , sing the cherubim
ABAB
dark days have passed , but you who taught me then
to look upon the world with trustful eyes
are not forgotten ! quick to sympathise
with noble thoughts , i 've dreamt of moments when
ABBA
your low voice filled with strains of fairer skies
stray breaths of grecian song that went and came
like floating fragrance from some quiet glen
in those far hills which shine with classic fame
ABAB
of passioned nymphs and grand browed god like men
i sometimes fear my heart hath lost the same
sweet sense of harmony ; but this i know
that beauty waits on you where'er you go
AABB
accustom 'd thus to bow the suppliant head
and reverence powers that shake his heart with dread
his pliant faith extends with easy ken
from heavenly hosts to heaven anointed men
AABB
the sword , the tripod join their mutual aids
to film his eyes with more impervious shades
create a sceptred idol , and enshrine
the robber chief in attributes divine
AABB
arm the new phantom with the nation 's rod
and hail the dreadful delegate of god
two settled slaveries thus the race control
engross their labors and debase their soul
AABB
champlain receives the congregated host
and his husht waves beneath the sails are lost
ticonderoga rears his rocks in vain
nor edward 's walls the weighty shock sustain
AABB
deep george 's loaded lake reluctant guides
their bounding barges o'er his sacred tides
state after state the splendid pomp appalls
each town surrenders , every fortress falls
AABB
sinclair retires ; and with his feeble train
in slow retreat o'er many a fatal plain
allures their march ; wide moves their furious force
and flaming hamlets mark their wasting course
AABB
batter my heart , three person 'd god , for you
as yet but knock ; breathe , shine , and seek to mend
that i may rise and stand , o'erthrow me , and bend
your force to break , blow , burn , and make me new
ABBA
i , like an usurped town , to another due
labour to admit you , but oh ! to no end
reason , your viceroy in me , we should defend
but is captived , and proves weak or untrue
ABBA
‘ comest thou , my son , alive , to realms beneath
the dolesome realms of darkness and of death
comest thou alive from pure , ethereal day
dire is the region , dismal is the way
AABB
here lakes profound , there floods oppose their waves
there the wide sea with all his billows raves
or ( since to dust proud troy submits her towers
comest thou a wanderer from the phrygian shores
AABB
why might i not for once be of that sect
which hold that souls , when nature hath her right
some other bodies to themselves elect
and sunlike make the day , and license night
ABAB
her virtue is the same and may be more
for as the sun is distant , so his power
in operation differs , and the store
of thick clouds interpos 'd make him less our
ABAB
god , through his offspring nature , gave me love
though man in opposition saith me nay
and taketh from my heart its life to day
as through the valley of the world i rove
ABBA
still unaccompanied , within the grove
that doth enamored beings hold at play
my spirit must pursue its lonely way
and strive to pluck some flowers that bloom above
ABBA
oh , wherefore then doth nature give desire
to have that which mankind may not possess
and force him to endure on earth hell 's fire
and live in one perpetual distress
ABAB
picture his pain , his misery , when first
his growing wants their proud concealment burst
when the first tears start from his stubborn soul
big , burning , solitary drops , that roll
AABB
down his pale cheek — the momentary gush
of human weakness — till the whirlwind rush
of pride , of shame , had dashed them from his eye
and his swollen heart heaved mad with agony
AABB
then , then the pain — the infinity of feeling
words fail to paint its anguish . reason , reeling
staggered with torture through his burning brain
while his teeth gnashed with bitterness and pain
AABB
he knows to live , who keeps the middle state
and neither leans on this side , nor on that
nor stops , for one bad cork , his butler 's pay
swears , like albutius , a good cook away
AABB
nor lets , like naevius , every error pass
the musty wine , foul cloth , or greasy glass
now hear what blessings temperance can bring
( thus said our friend , and what he said i sing
AABB
first health : the stomach ( cramm 'd from every dish
a tomb of boil 'd and roast , and flesh and fish
where bile , and wind , and phlegm , and acid jar
and all the man is one intestine war
AABB
continued john :— now i will thee instruct
the proper manner , matters to conduct
for thee to have a clever mare by day
and still at night a charming wife survey
AABB
face , legs , and ev'ry thing shall reappear
come , see it done , and i 'll perform it here
thou'lt then the method fully comprehend
but hold thy tongue , or all will quickly end
AABB
a single word the magick would dispel
and , during life , no more with us ‘ twould dwell
keep close thy mouth and merely ope ’ thy eyes
a glimpse alone to learn it will suffice
AABB
the single eye , the daughter of the light
well pleased to recognise in lowliest shade
some glimmer of its parent beam , and made
by daily draughts of brightness , inly bright
ABBA
the taste severe , yet graceful , trained aright
in classic depth and clearness , and repaid
by thanks and honour from the wise and staid
by pleasant skill to blame , and yet delight
ABBA
and high communion with the eloquent throng
of those who purified our speech and song
all these are yours . the same examples lure
you in each woodland , me on breezy moor
AABB
what part is left thee , lion ? ravenous beast
which hadst the world for pasture , and for scope
and compass of thine homicidal hope
the kingdom of the spirit of man , the feast
ABBA
of souls subdued from west to sunless east
from blackening north to bloodred south aslope
all servile ; earth for footcloth of the pope
and heaven for chancel ceiling of the priest
ABBA
thou that hadst earth by right of rack and rod
thou that hadst rome because thy name was god
and by thy creed 's gift heaven wherein to dwell
heaven laughs with all his light and might above
AABB
jones ! when from calais southward you and i
travell 'd on foot together ; then this way
which i am pacing now , was like the may
with festivals of new born liberty
ABBA
a homeless sound of joy was in the sky
the antiquated earth , as one might say
beat like the heart of man : songs , garlands , play
banners , and happy faces , far and nigh
ABBA
and now , sole register that these things were
two solitary greetings have i heard
“ good morrow , citizen ! ” a hollow word
as if a dead man spake it ! yet despair
ABBA
oh , solitude ! thou wonder working fay
come nurse my feeble fancy in your arms
though i , and thee , and fancy town pent lay
come , call around , a world of country charms
ABAB
let all this room , these walls dissolve away
and bring me surrey 's fields to take their place
this floor be grass , and draughts as breezes play
yon curtains trees , to wave in summer 's face
ABAB
my ceiling , sky ; my water jug a stream
my bed , a bank , on which to muse and dream
the spell is wrought : imagination swells
my sleeping room to hills , and woods , and dells
AABB
i found a torrent falling in a glen
where the sun 's light shone silvered and leaf split
the boom , the foam , and the mad flash of it
all made a magic symphony ; but when
ABBA
i thought upon the coming of hard men
to cut those patriarchal trees away
and turn to gold the silver of that spray
i shuddered . yet a gladness now and then
ABBA
did wake me to myself till i was glad
in earnest , and was welcoming the time
for screaming saws to sound above the chime
of idle waters , and for me to know
ABBA
the tree of faith its bare , dry boughs must shed
that nearer heaven the living ones may climb
the false must fail , though from our shores of time
the old lament be heard , “ great pan is dead
ABBA
that wail is error 's , from his high place hurled
this sharp recoil is evil undertrod
our time 's unrest , an angel sent of god
troubling with life the waters of the world
ABBA
even as they list the winds of the spirit blow
to turn or break our century rusted vanes
sands shift and waste ; the rock alone remains
where , led of heaven , the strong tides come and go
ABBA
slow toiling upward from ’ the misty vale
i leave the bright enamelled zones below
no more for me their beauteous bloom shall glow
their lingering sweetness load the morning gale
ABBA
few are the slender flowerets , scentless , pale
that on their ice clad stems all trembling blow
along the margin of unmelting snow
yet with unsaddened voice thy verge i hail
ABBA
white realm of peace above the flowering line
welcome thy frozen domes , thy rocky spires
o'er thee undimmed the moon girt planets shine
on thy majestic altars fade the fires
ABAB
star sirius and the pole star dwell afar
beyond the drawings each of other 's strength
one blazes through the brief bright summer 's length
lavishing life heat from a flaming car
ABBA
while one unchangeable upon a throne
broods o'er the frozen heart of earth alone
content to reign the bright particular star
of some who wander or of some who groan
AABB
here on the monarch ’ s speech achilles broke
and furious , thus , and interrupting spoke
“ tyrant , i well deserved thy galling chain
to live thy slave , and still to serve in vain
AABB
should i submit to each unjust decree
command thy vassals , but command not me
seize on briseis , whom the grecians doom ’ d
my prize of war , yet tamely see resumed
AABB
and seize secure ; no more achilles draws
his conquering sword in any woman ’ s cause
the gods command me to forgive the past
but let this first invasion be the last
AABB
green little vaulter in the sunny grass
catching your heart up at the feel of june
sole voice that 's heard amidst the lazy noon
when even the bees lag at the summoning brass
ABBA
and you , warm little housekeeper , who class
with those who think the candles come too soon
loving the fire , and with your tricksome tune
nick the glad silent moments as they pass
ABBA
o sweet and tiny cousins , that belong
one to the fields , the other to the hearth
both have your sunshine ; both , though small , are strong
at your clear hearts ; and both seem given to earth
ABAB
i never thought then little kitty malone
as heir to old gripus would bring him the cash
‘ pon which as a banker jack merdle has shone
and kitty in fashion has cut such a dash
ABAB
nor when as a girl not a shoe to her feet
she accepted my offers of coppers or candy
she would tell me in satin “ we 've nothing to eat
while eating from silver or sipping her brandy
ABAB
and wond'ring that merdle , the jack i have named
should bring home a friend — ( ‘ twas thus she exclaimed
the day that i 've mentioned — a day to remember
when merdle and i in his carriage and bays
AABB
i mark , as april days serenely smile
clouds heaped on clouds in mountain like array
while radiant sunbeams with their summits play
gilding with gorgeous tints the mighty pile
ABBA
thither , in vain , with rapid step i 've sped
i liken this to hope : although with sorrow
the heart is overcast , and dim the eye
delusive hope — not present , ever nigh
AABB
howe'er this fair , amid adventures dire
more sufferings shared than malice could desire
though eight times , doubtless , she exchanged her knight
no proof , that she her spouse was led to slight
AABB
‘ twas gratitude , compassion , or good will
the dread of worse ;— she 'd truly had her fill
excuses just , to vindicate her fame
who , spite of troubles , fanned the monarch 's flame
AABB
of eight the relict , still a maid received
apparently , the prince her pure believed
for , though at times we may be duped in this
yet , after such a number — strange to miss
AABB
no song nor dance i bring from yon great city
that queens it o'er our taste — the more 's the pity
tho ’ , by the by , abroad why will you roam
good sense and taste are natives here at home
AABB
but not for panegyric i appear
i come to wish you all a good new year
old father time deputes me here before ye
not for to preach , but tell his simple story
AABB
the sage grave ancient cough 'd , and bade me say
“ you 're one year older this important day
if wiser too — he hinted some suggestion
but ‘ twould be rude , you know , to ask the question
AABB
in drunkenness what pow ’ rful magic lies
what ’ s most envelop ’ d from researching eyes
( transparent thing !) it evidently shows
the innocent no dark disguises knows
AABB
by her commands our hopes maturely rise
push ’ d on to war the coward dauntless dies
and sinking minds beneath unwieldy care
cast off the load , and move with sprightful air
AABB
to her , all arts their origin must owe
what wretch so dull but eloquent must grow
when the full goblets with persuasive wine
inebriate with bright elegance divine
AABB
the weary mariner so fast not flies
a howling tempest , harbour to attain
nor shepherd hastes , when frays of wolves arise
so fast to fold , to save his bleating train
ABAB
as i , wing 'd with contempt and just disdain
now fly the world , and what it most doth prize
and sanctuary seek , free to remain
from wounds of abject times , and envy 's eyes
ABAB
to me this world did once seem sweet and fair
while senses ’ light mind 's prospective kept blind
now , like imagined landscape in the air
and weeping rainbows , her best joys i find
ABAB
if thou hadst been a sculptor , what a race
of forms divine had ever preached to men
lo , i behold thy brow , all glorious then
( its reflex dawning on the statue 's face
ABBA
bringing its thought to birth in human grace
the soul of the grand form , upstarting , when
thou openest thus thy mysteries to our ken
striking a marble window through blind space
ABBA
but god , who mouldeth in life plastic clay
flashing his thoughts from men with living eyes
not from still marble forms , changeless alway
breathed forth his human self in human guise
ABAB
thine eyes ’ blue tenderness , thy long fair hair
and the warm lustre of thy features — caught
from contemplation — where serenely wrought
seems sorrow 's softness charmed from its despair
ABBA
have thrown such speaking sadness in thine air
that — but i know thy blessed bosom fraught
with mines of unalloyed and stainless thought
i should have deemed thee doomed to earthly care
ABBA
with such an aspect , by his colours blent
when from his beauty breathing pencil born
( except that thou hast nothing to repent
the magdalen of guido saw the morn
ABAB
praise where so er't be found , if it be due
shall no vaine cullour neede to set it foorth
why should i idely then extoll the worth
which heere ( dere friend ) i finde belong to you
ABBA
and if i er 'd , full well the learned knewe
how wide , amisse my mark i taken had
since they distinguish can the good from bad
and through the varnish well discerne the hewe
ABBA
be glad therefore , this makes for you , and knowe
when wiser readers , heere shall fixe their sight
for vertues sake , they will doe vertue right
so shalt thou not ( friend ) vnrewarded goe
ABBA
let not the mitre england 's prelate wears
next to the crown whose regal pomp it shares
though low before it courtly christians bow
leave its red mark on younger england 's brow
AABB
we love , we honor , the maternal dame
but let her priesthood wear a modest name
while through the waters of the pilgrim 's bay
a new born mayflower shows her keels the way
AABB
too old grew britain for her mother 's beads
must we be necklaced with her children 's creeds
welcome alike in surplice or in gown
the loyal lieges of the heavenly crown
AABB
o from what power hast thou this powerful might
with insufficiency my heart to sway
to make me give the lie to my true sight
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
ABAB
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantise of skill
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
ABAB
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
ABAB
lady , to death we 're doom 'd , our crime the same
thou , that in me thou kindled'st such fierce heat
i , that my heart did of a sun so sweet
the rays concentre to so hot a flame
ABBA
i , fascinated by an adder 's eye
deaf as an adder thou to all my pain
thou obstinate in scorn , in passion i
i lov 'd too much , too much didst thou disdain
ABAB
hear then our doom in hell as just as stern
our sentence equal as our crimes conspire
who living bask 'd at beauty 's earthly fire
in living flames eternal these must burn
ABBA
yet ah ! whence comes this visionary scene
‘ t is fancy 's wild a ë rial dream i ween
by her inspired , when reason takes its flight
what fond illusions beam upon the sight
AABB
she waves her hand , and lo ! what forms appear
what magic sounds salute the wondering ear
once more o'er distant regions do we tread
and the cold grave yields up its cherish 'd dead
AABB
while , present sorrows banish 'd far away
unclouded azure gilds the placid day
or , in the future 's cloud encircled face
fair scenes of bliss to come we fondly trace
AABB
how sweet it is , when mother fancy rocks
the wayward brain , to saunter through a wood
an old place , full of many a lovely brood
tall trees , green arbours , and ground flowers in flocks
ABBA
and wild rose tip toe upon hawthorn stocks
like to a bonny lass , who plays her pranks
at wakes and fairs with wandering mountebanks
when she stands cresting the clown 's head , and mocks
ABBA
the crowd beneath her . verily i think
such place to me is sometimes like a dream
or map of the whole world : thoughts , link by link
enter through ears and eyesight , with such gleam
ABAB
only until this cigarette is ended
a little moment at the end of all
while on the floor the quiet ashes fall
and in the firelight to a lance extended
ABBA
bizarrely with the jazzing music blended
the broken shadow dances on the wall
i will permit my memory to recall
the vision of you , by all my dreams attended
ABBA
and then adieu ,— farewell !— the dream is done
yours is a face of which i can forget
the color and the features , every one
the words not ever , and the smiles not yet
ABAB
when i consider how my light is spent
ere half my days , in this dark world and wide
and that one talent which is death to hide
lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent
ABBA
to serve therewith my maker , and present
my true account , lest he returning chide
“ doth god exact day labour , light denied
i fondly ask . but patience , to prevent
ABBA
that murmur , soon replies , “ god doth not need
either man 's work , or his own gifts . who best
bear his mild yoke , they serve him best : his state
is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed
ABBA
therefore your halls , your ancient colleges
your portals statued with old kings and queens
your bridges and your busted libraries
wax lighted chapels and rich carved screens
ABAB
your doctors and your proctors and your deans
shall not avail you when the day beam sports
new risen o'er awakened albion — no
nor yet your solemn organ pipes that blow
AABB
melodious thunders through your vacant courts
at morn and even ; for your manner sorts
not with this age , nor with the thoughts that roll
because the words of little children preach
AABB
but earth is now thy living picture , where
thou shadowest truth , the simple and profound
by the same form in vital union bound
where one can see but the first step of thy stair
ABBA
another sees it vanish far in air
when thy king david viewed the starry round
from heart and fingers broke the psaltery sound
lord , what is man , that thou shouldst mind his prayer
ABBA
but when the child beholds the heavens on high
he babbles childish noises — not less dear
than what the king sang praying — to the ear
of him who made the child and king and sky
ABBA
“ thou noblest monument of albion 's isle
whether , by merlin 's aid , from scythia 's shore
to amber 's fatal plain pendragon bore
huge frame of giant hands , the mighty pile
ABBA
t'entomb his britons slain by hengist 's guile
or druid priests , sprinkled with human gore
taught mid thy massy maze their mystic lore
or danish chiefs , enrich 'd with savage spoil
ABBA
to victory 's idol vast , an unhewn shrine
rear 'd the rude heap , or in thy hallow 'd ground
repose the kings of brutus ’ genuine line
or here those kings in solemn state were crown 'd
ABAB
the patriarch look 'd ; and every frontier height
pours down the swarthy nations to the fight
where kennebec 's high source forsakes the sky
where long champlain 's yet unkeel 'd waters lie
AABB
where hudson crowds his hill dissundering tide
where kaatskill dares the starry vault divide
where the dim alleganies sit sublime
and give their streams to every neighboring clime
AABB
i wish 'd that those characters could explain
whom i will never wrong with hope to win
or that by them a copy might be ta'en
by you alone what thoughts i have within
ABAB
but since the hand of nature did not set
( as providently loath to have it known
the means to find that hidden alphabet
mine eyes shall be th ’ interpreters alone
ABAB
in vain do earthly princes then , in vain
seek with pyramids to heaven aspir 'd
or huge collosses , built with costly pain
or brazen pillars never to be fir 'd
ABAB
or shrines , made of the metal most desir 'd
to make their memories for ever live
for how can mortal immortality give
for deeds do die , however nobly done
ABBA
and thoughts of men do in themselves decay
but wise words taught in numbers for to run
recorded by the muses , live for aye
ne may with storming showers be wash 'd away
ABBA
great things were ne'er begotten in an hour
ephemerons in birth , are such in life
and he who dareth , in the noble strife
of intellects , to cope for real power
ABBA
stand in the arena . laurels that are won
plucked from green boughs , soon wither ; those that last
are gather 'd patiently , when sultry noon
and summer 's fiery glare in vain are past
ABAB
if i was drawn here from a distant place
‘ twas not to pray nor hear our friend 's address
but , gazing once more on your winsome face
to worship there ideal loveliness
ABAB
on that pure shrine that has too long ignored
the gifts that once i brought so frequently
i lay this votive offering , to record
how sweet your quiet beauty seemed to me
ABAB
yet not in vain , o river of yesterday
through chasms of darkness to the deep descending
i heard thee sobbing in the rain , and blending
thy voice with other voices far away
ABBA
i called to thee , and yet thou wouldst not stay
but turbulent , and with thyself contending
and torrent like thy force on pebbles spending
thou wouldst not listen to a poet 's lay
ABBA
thoughts , like a loud and sudden rush of wings
regrets and recollections of things past
with hints and prophecies of things to be
and inspirations , which , could they be things
ABBA
with sense of wrong and outrage desperate
strode on and thundered at the palace gate
rushed through the court yard , thrusting in his rage
to right and left each seneschal and page
AABB
and hurried up the broad and sounding stair
his white face ghastly in the torches ’ glare
from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed
voices and cries he heard , but did not heed
AABB
what hast thou done ? hark , till thine ears wax hot
judas ; for these and these things hast thou done
thou hast made earth faint , and sickened the sweet sun
with fume of blood that reeks from limbs that rot
ABBA
thou hast washed thine hands and mouth , saying , “ am i not
clean ? ” and thy lips were bloody , and there was none
to speak for man against thee , no , not one
this hast thou done to us , iscariot
ABBA
therefore , though thou be deaf and heaven be dumb
a cry shall be from under to proclaim
in the ears of all who shed men 's blood or sell
pius the ninth , judas the second , come
ABBA
but found them not , alas ! nor was there aught
the world contains , the which he could approve
through the unheeding many he did move
a splendour among shadows , a bright blot
ABBA
streets and the solitude of country places
were once his friends . but as a man born blind
opening his eyes from lovely dreams , might find
the world a desert and men 's larval faces
ABBA
so hateful , he would wish to seek again
the darkness and his old chimeric sight
of beauties inward — so , that fresh delight
vision of bright fields and angelic men
ABBA
my heart is tuned to sorrow , and the strings
vibrate most readily to minor chords
searching and sad ; my mind is stuffed with words
which voice the passion and the ache of things
ABBA
illusions beating with their baffled wings
against the walls of circumstance , and hoards
of torn desires , broken joys ; records
of all a bruised life 's maimed imaginings
ABBA
now you are come ! you tremble like a star
poised where , behind earth 's rim , the sun has set
your voice has sung across my heart , but numb
and mute , i have no tones to answer . far
ABBA
he waits all day beside his little flock
and asks the passing stranger what 's o'clock
but those who often pass his daily tasks
look at their watch and tell before he asks
AABB
he mutters stories to himself and lies
where the thick hedge the warmest house supplies
and when he hears the hunters far and wide
he climbs the highest tree to see them ride
AABB
he climbs till all the fields are blea and bare
and makes the old crow 's nest an easy chair
and soon his sheep are got in other grounds
he hastens down and fears his master come
AABB
“ yes ! smiling flora drives her armed car
through the thick ranks of vegetable war
herb , shrub , and tree , with strong emotions rise
for light and air , and battle in the skies
AABB
whose roots diverging with opposing toil
contend below for moisture and for soil
round the tall elm the flattering ivies bend
and strangle , as they clasp , their struggling friend
AABB
envenom 'd dews from mancinella flow
and scald with caustic touch the tribes below
dense shadowy leaves on stems aspiring borne
with blight and mildew thin the realms of corn
AABB
a gallant bark was gliding o'er the seas
and , like a living mass , before the breeze
swept on majestic , as a thing of mind
whose spirit held communion with the wind
AABB
rearing and rising o'er the billowed tide
as a proud steed doth toss its head in pride
upon its deck young edmund silent stood
a son of sadness ; and his mournful mood
AABB
grew day by day , while wave on wave rolled by
and he their homeward current with a sigh
followed with fondness . still the vessel bore
the wanderer onward from his native shore
AABB
“ if equal honours by the partial skies
are doom ’ d both heroes , ( juno thus replies
if thetis ’ son must no distinction know
then hear , ye gods ! the patron of the bow
AABB
but hector only boasts a mortal claim
his birth deriving from a mortal dame
achilles , of your own ethereal race
springs from a goddess by a man ’ s embrace
AABB
— lo ! to each other nymph , in turn , applied
as if , in air unseen , some hovering hand
some chaste and angel friend to virgin fame
with whisper 'd spell had burst the starting band
ABAB
it left unblest her loathed dishonour 'd side
happier , hopeless fair , if never
her baffled hand , with vain endeavour
had touch 'd that fatal zone to her denied
ABBA
like to a little child , whose straying feet
tracking the fox fire 's guiling glint and gleam
have wandered far afield by marsh and stream
while just before the wavering glimmers fleet
ABBA
on and still on where sky and meadow meet
till , spent and fearful in the gathering gloom
at last he sees the guiding light of home
where love awaits and mother kisses sweet
ABBA
i have no hope to make you live in rhyme
or with your beauty to enrich the years
enough for me this now , this present time
the greater claim for greater sonneteers
ABAB
but o how covetous i am of now
dear human minutes , marred by human pains
i want to know your lips , your cheek , your brow
and all the miracles your heart contains
ABAB
i wish to study all your changing face
your eyes , divinely hurt with tenderness
i hope to win your dear unstinted grace
for these blunt rhymes and what they would express
ABAB
retourne agayne , my forces late dismayd
unto the siege by you abandon 'd quite
great shame it is to leave , like one afrayd
so fayre a peece * for one repulse so light
ABAB
‘ gaynst such strong castles needeth greater might
then those small forts which ye were wont belay
such haughty mynds , enur 'd to hardy fight
disdayne to yield unto the first assay
ABAB
bring therefore all the forces that ye may
and lay incessant battery to her heart
playnts , prayers , vowes , ruth , sorrow , and dismay
those engins can the proudest love convert
ABAB
the rafters creak ; an empty cupboard door
swings open ; now a wild plank of the floor
breaks from its joist , and leaps behind my foot
down from the chimney half a pound of soot
AABB
tumbles , and lies , and shakes itself again
the putty cracks against the window pane
a piece of paper in the basket shoves
another piece , and toward the bottom moves
AABB
my independent pencil , while i write
breaks at the point : the ruminating clock
stirs all its body and begins to rock
warning the waiting presence of the night
ABBA
ah licia , sigh and say thou art my own
nay , be my own , as you full oft have said
so shall your truth unto the world be known
and i resolved where now i am afraid
ABAB
and if my tongue eternize can your praise
or silly speech increase your worthy fame
if ought i can , to heaven your worth can raise
the age to come shall wonder at the same
ABAB
in this respect your love , sweet love , i told
my faith and truth i vowed should be forever
you were the cause if that i was too bold
then pardon this my fault or love me never
ABAB
this doctrine has the sanction of assent
from nature 's universal parliament
the voice of nations , and the course of things
allow that laws superior are to kings
AABB
none but delinquents would have justice cease
knaves rail at laws , as soldiers rail at peace
for justice is the end of government
as reason is the test of argument
AABB
no man was ever yet so void of sense
as to debate the right of self defence
a principle so grafted in the mind
with nature born , and does like nature bind
AABB
london unfurls its incense coloured dusk
before the panes , rich but a while ago
with the charred gold and the red ember glow
of dying sunset . houses quit the husk
ABBA
of secrecy , which , through the day , returns
a blank to all enquiry : but at nights
the cheerfulness of fire and lamp invites
the darkness inward , curious of what burns
ABBA
with such a coloured life when all is dead
the daylight world outside , with overhead
white clouds , and where we walk , the blaze
of wet and sunlit streets , shops and the stream
AABB
“ dear brother , dearest friend , when i am dead
and you shall see no more this face of mine
let nothing but red roses be the sign
of the white life i lost for him , ” she said
ABBA
“ no , do not curse him , — pity him instead
forgive him ! — forgive me ! . . god 's anodyne
for human hate is pity ; and the wine
that makes men wise , forgiveness . i have read
ABBA
love 's message in love 's murder , and i die
and so they laid her just where she would lie
under red roses . red they bloomed and fell
but when flushed autumn and the snows went by
AABB
the church bells tolled , the chant of monks drew near
loud trumpets stammered forth their notes of fear
a line of torches smoked along the street
there was a stir , a rush , a tramp of feet
AABB
and , with its banners floating in the air
slowly the long procession crossed the square
and , to the statues of the prophets bound
the victims stood , with fagots piled around
AABB
then all the air a blast of trumpets shook
and louder sang the monks with bell and book
and the hidalgo , lofty , stern , and proud
lifted his torch , and , bursting through the crowd
AABB
so from the sluices of ulysses ’ eyes
fast fell the tears , and sighs succeeded sighs
conceal 'd he grieved : the king observed alone
the silent tear , and heard the secret groan
AABB
then to the bard aloud : “ o cease to sing
dumb be thy voice , and mute the tuneful string
to every note his tears responsive flow
and his great heart heaves with tumultuous woe
AABB
thy lay too deeply moves : then cease the lay
and o'er the banquet every heart be gay
this social right demands : for him the sails
floating in air , invite the impelling gales
AABB
twitching his visage into as many puckers
as damsels wont to put into their tuckers
( ere liberal fashion damn 'd both lace and lawn
and bade the vail of modesty be drawn
AABB
there 's not in heaven itself a lovelier sight
nor one which angels view with more delight
than youthful soldiers of immanuel 's cross
in life 's glad morning counting all as loss
AABB
since they have proved a dying saviour 's love
and placed their treasures and their hearts above
let pleasure woo them with her syren voice
they heed her not — they 've made a nobler choice
AABB
let others walk the shining path of fame
they dare to suffer poverty and shame
and turning from the world 's enchanted bowers
to consecrate their youth and all their powers
AABB
still in the trace of one perplex è d thought
my ceaseless cares continually run on
seeking in vain what i have ever sought
one in my love , and her hard heart still one
ABAB
i who did never joy in other sun
and have no stars but those that must fulfil
the work of rigour , fatally begun
upon this heart whom cruelty will kill
ABAB
injurious delia !— yet , i love thee still
and will whilst i shall draw this breath of mine
i 'll tell the world that i deserved but ill
and blame myself , t'excuse that heart of thine
ABAB
and thou , o power , that ‘ stablishest the nation
give wisdom in the midst of our elation
who are so free that we forget we are
that freedom brings the deepest obligation
AABB
these flowers awoke in beauty and delight
at early dawn , when stars began to set
at eve they leave us but a fond regret
locked in the cold embraces of the night
ABBA
these shades that shame the rainbow 's arch of light
where gold and snow in purple pomp are met
all give a warning man should not forget
when one brief day can darken things so bright
ABBA
‘ tis but to wither that the roses bloom
‘ tis to grow old they bear their beauteous flowers
one crimson bud their cradle and their tomb
such are man 's fortunes in this world of ours
ABAB
‘ and scandal added ’ —— ‘ hold ! ’ the miller cried
and , in an instant , stood at phoebe 's side
for he observed , while list'ning to the tale
her spirits faulter 'd , and her cheeks turn 'd pale
AABB
whilst her clasp 'd hands descended to her knee
she sinking whisper 'd forth , ‘ o god , ‘ tis he
the good man , though he guess 'd the pleasing truth
was far too busy to inform the youth
AABB
but stirr 'd himself amain to aid his wife
who soon restor 'd the trembler back to life
awhile insensible she still appear 'd
but , ‘ o my brother ! ’ was distinctly heard
AABB
joy like a stream flows through the christmas streets
but i am sitting in my silent room
sitting all silent in congenial gloom
to night , while half the world the other greets
ABBA
heap upon heap the pallid victims lay
of racking pain and scorching thirst the prey
in anguish rolled upon the bloody ground
and wider still they tore each gaping wound
AABB
in concert joined their agonizing cries
gnashed with their teeth and rolled their blood shot eyes
with feeble groans they drew each painful breath
and racked with torments called aloud for death
AABB
far o'er the field in wild confusion rose
piles of the ghastly dead — of friends and foes
in death stretched side by side , mangled and cold
while over all the sulphurous war clouds rolled
AABB
there is a festival , where knights and dames
and aught that wealth or lofty lineage claims
appear — a high born and a welcome guest
to otho 's hall came lara with the rest
AABB
the long carousal shakes the illumined hall
well speeds alike the banquet and the ball
and the gay dance of bounding beauty 's train
links grace and harmony in happiest chain
AABB
blest are the early hearts and gentle hands
that mingle there in well according bands
it is a sight the careful brow might smooth
and make age smile , and dream itself to youth
AABB
“ onward with march sublime in saffron robe
young hymen steps , and traverses the globe
o'er burning sands , and snow clad mountains , treads
blue fields of air , and ocean 's briny beds
AABB
flings from his radiant torch celestial light
o'er day 's wide concave , and illumes the night
with dulcet eloquence his tuneful tongue
convokes and captivates the fair and young
AABB
his golden lamp with ray ethereal dyes
the blushing cheek , and lights the laughing eyes
with secret flames the virgin 's bosom warms
and lights the impatient bridegroom to her arms
AABB
how careful was i when i took my way
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood , in sure wards of trust
ABAB
but thou , to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy comfort , now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest , and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief
ABAB
thee have i not locked up in any chest
save where thou art not , though i feel thou art
within the gentle closure of my breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
ABAB
the new come settlers now with speed prepare
to log the fallow they have cleared with care
for summer , with her heat intense , has fled
and fruit crowned autumn has come in her stead
AABB
the brush , well dried , is burnt ; and all around
logs , black and charred , are lying on the ground
these into heaps must every one be drawn
by means which to all bush men are well known
AABB
have they not strength or time the work to do
they ask their neighbor 's help , and oxen , too
and fellow feeling , sprung from their own need
leads these the summons to obey with speed
AABB
when winds that move not its calm surface sweep
the azure sea , i love the land no more
the smiles of the serene and tranquil deep
tempt my unquiet mind .— but when the roar
ABAB
of ocean 's gray abyss resounds , and foam
gathers upon the sea , and vast waves burst
i turn from the drear aspect to the home
of earth and its deep woods , where , interspersed
ABAB
and after further compliment and talk
among the dahlias in the garden walk
he left his guests ; and to his cottage turned
and as he entered for a moment yearned
AABB
for the lost splendors of the days of old
the ruby glass , the silver and the gold
and felt how piercing is the sting of pride
by want embittered and intensified
AABB
he looked about him for some means or way
to keep this unexpected holiday
searched every cupboard , and then searched again
summoned the maid , who came , but came in vain
AABB
i know that all beneath the moon decays
and what by mortals in this world is brought
in time 's great periods shall return to nought
that fairest states have fatal nights and days
ABBA
i know that all the muse 's heavenly lays
with toil of sp'rit , which are so dearly bought
as idle sounds , of few , or none , are sought
that there is nothing lighter than vain praise
ABBA
i know frail beauty like the purple flower
to which one morn oft birth and death affords
that love a jarring is of minds ’ accords
where sense and will envassal reason 's power
ABBA
children of later growth , we love the play
we love its heroes , be they grave or gay
from squeaking , peppery , devil defying punch
to roaring richard with his camel hunch
AABB
adore its heroines , those immortal dames
time 's only rivals , whom he never tames
whose youth , unchanging , lives while thrones decay
( age spares the pyramids and dejazet
AABB
the saucy aproned , razor tongued soubrette
the blond haired beauty with the eyes of jet
the gorgeous beings whom the viewless wires
lift to the skies in strontian crimsoned fires
AABB
to him the man of woes ; “ o gracious jove
reward this stranger 's hospitable love
who knows the son of sorrow to relieve
cheers the sad heart , nor lets affliction grieve
AABB
of all the ills unhappy mortals know
a life of wanderings is the greatest woe
on all their weary ways wait care and pain
and pine and penury , a meagre train
AABB
to such a man since harbour you afford
relate the farther fortunes of your lord
what cares his mother 's tender breast engage
and sire forsaken on the verge of age
AABB
friend to my life ! ( which did not you prolong
the world had wanted many an idle song
what drop or nostrum can this plague remove
or which must end me , a fool 's wrath or love
AABB
a dire dilemma ! either way i 'm sped
if foes , they write , if friends , they read me dead
seiz 'd and tied down to judge , how wretched i
who can n't be silent , and who will not lie
AABB
to laugh , were want of goodness and of grace
and to be grave , exceeds all pow'r of face
i sit with sad civility , i read
with honest anguish , and an aching head
AABB
our teachers teach that one and one make two
later , love rules that one and one make one
abstruse the problems ! neither need we shun
but skilfully to each should yield its due
ABBA
the narrower total seems to suit the few
the wider total suits the common run
each obvious in its sphere like moon or sun
both provable by me , and both by you
ABBA
befogged and witless , in a wordy maze
a groping stroll perhaps may do us good
if cloyed we are with much we have understood
if tired of half our dusty world and ways
ABBA
men call you fayre , and you doe credit it
for that your selfe ye daily such doe see
but the trew fayre , that is the gentle wit
and vertuous mind , is much more praysd of me
ABAB
for all the rest , how ever fayre it be
shall turne to nought and lose that glorious hew
but onely that is permanent , and free
from frayle corruption that doth flesh ensew
ABAB
that is true beautie : that doth argue you
to be divine , and born of heavenly seed
deriv 'd from that fayre spirit from whom all true
and perfect beauty did at first proceed
ABAB
if that i die , fair licia , with disdain
or heartless live surpris è d with thy wrong
then heavens and earth shall accent both my pain
and curse the time so cruel and so long
ABAB
if you be kind , my queen , as you are fair
and aid my thoughts that still for conquest strive
then will i sing and never more despair
and praise your kindness whilst i am alive
ABAB
till then i pay the tribute of my tears
to move thy mercy and thy constant truth
respect , fair love , how these with sorrow wears
the truest heart unless it find some ruth

and piram of jarmuth , drunk with strange wine
who dreamed he had fashioned all stars that shine
and debir of eglon wild , without pity
who raged like a plague in the midst of his city

forgiving one another all that ill

his speech thus ended short , he frowning rose
and twenty chiefs renowned for valour chose
down to the strand he speeds with haughty strides

but to return to our forlorn gallant
whose bosom for the lady 's ‘ gan to pant
he , to his doctor , not a word had said
now here , now there , he tried to pop his head
AABB
but neither door nor window could he find
where he might glimpse the object of his mind
or even hear her voice , or sound her name
no fortress had he ever found the same
AABB
yet still to conquer he was quite resolved
and oft the manner in his mind revolved
this plan at length he thought would best succeed
to execute it doubtless he had need
AABB
thus some diviner muse her hero forms
not soothed with soft delights , but toss 'd in storms
nor stretch 'd on roses in the myrtle grove
nor crowns his days with mirth , his nights with love
AABB
but far removed in thundering camps is found
his slumbers short , his bed the herbless ground
in tasks of danger always seen the first
feeds from the hedge , and slakes with ice his thirst
AABB
long must his patience strive with fortune 's rage
and long opposing gods themselves engage
must see his country flame , his friends destroy 'd
before the promised empire be enjoy 'd
AABB
burst , burst , poor heart ! thou hast no longer hope
captive mine eyes unto eternal sleep
let all my senses have no further scope
let death be lord of me and all my sheep

for phillis hath betroth è d fierce disdain
that makes his mortal mansion in her heart
and though my tongue have long time taken pain
to sue divorce and wed her to desert

she will not yield , my words can have no power
she scorns my faith , she laughs at my sad lays
she fills my soul with never ceasing sour
who filled the world with volumes of her praise

and hellgate rocks reverberate the roar
swift o'er the shuddering isles that line the bay
the red flags wave , and battering engines play
AABB
howe leads aland the interminable train
while his bold brother still bestorms the main
great albion 's double pride ; both famed afar
on each vext element , each world of war
AABB
ready to seek out death in my disgrace
my mistress ‘ gan to smooth her gathered brows
whereby i am repriev è d for a space
o hope and fear ! who half your torments knows
ABAB
it is some mercy in a black mouthed judge
to haste his prisoner 's end , if he must die
dear , if all other favour you shall grudge
do speedy execution with your eye
ABAB
with one sole look you leave in me no soul
count it a loss to lose a faithful slave
would god , that i might hear my last bell toll
so in your bosom i might dig a grave
ABAB
i know not if i love her overmuch
but this i know , that when unto her face
she lifts her hand , which rests there , still , a space
then slowly falls — ‘ tis i who feel that touch
ABBA
and when she sudden shakes her head , with such
a look , i soon her secret meaning trace
so when she runs i think ‘ tis i who race
like a poor cripple who has lost his crutch
ABBA
i am if she is gone ; and when she goes
i know not why , for that is a strange art
as if myself should from myself depart
i know not if i love her more than those
ABBA
now , driven by force celestial o'er the tides
with lightning speed the rapid pinnace glides
‘ till , having finish 'd its predestined way
its winged motions silently decay
AABB
and now , from slumber rous 'd , ernestus spied
a river , branching from the ocean tide
the mighty stream roll 'd on its darksome flood
thro ’ mossy cavern and thro ’ tangled wood
AABB
thence in soft mazes drew its humid train
to feed the verdure of a lonely plain
he furl 'd the sail , and grasp 'd the labouring oar
and sped to dalecarlia 's welcome shore
AABB
the sea was sapphire coloured , and the sky
burned like a heated opal through the air
we hoisted sail ; the wind was blowing fair
for the blue lands that to the eastward lie
ABBA
from the steep prow i marked with quickening eye
zakynthos , every olive grove and creek
ithaca 's cliff , lycaon 's snowy peak
and all the flower strewn hills of arcady
ABBA
the flapping of the sail against the mast
the ripple of the water on the side
the ripple of girls ’ laughter at the stern
the only sounds : when ‘ gan the west to burn
AABB
this infant world has taken long to make
nor hast thou done with it , but mak'st it yet
and wilt be working on when death has set
a new mound in some churchyard for my sake
ABBA
on flow the centuries without a break
uprise the mountains , ages without let
the lichens suck ; the hard rock 's breast they fret
years more than past , the young earth yet will take
ABBA
but in the dumbness of the rolling time
no veil of silence shall encompass me
thou wilt not once forget and let me be
rather wouldst thou some old chaotic prime
ABBA
the weary yeare his race now having run
the new begins his compast course anew
with shew of morning mylde he bath begun
betokening peace and plenty to ensew
ABAB
so let us , which this chaunge of weather vew
chaunge eke our mynds , and former lives amend
the old yeares sinnes forepast let us eschew
and fly the faults with which we did offend
ABAB
then shall the new yeares ioy forth freshly send
into the glooming world his gladsome ray
and all these stormes , which now his beauty blend
shall turne to calmes , and tymely cleare away
ABAB
yet in the darksome crypt i left so late
whose only altar is its rusted grate
sepulchral , rayless , joyless as it seems
shamed by the glare of may 's refulgent beams
AABB
while the dim seasons dragged their shrouded train
its paler splendors were not quite in vain
from these dull bars the cheerful firelight 's glow
streamed through the casement o'er the spectral snow
AABB
here , while the night wind wreaked its frantic will
on the loose ocean and the rock bound hill
rent the cracked topsail from its quivering yard
and rived the oak a thousand storms had scarred
AABB
fair is my love , and cruel as she 's fair
her brow shades frown , although her eyes are sunny
her smiles are lightning , though her pride despair
and her disdains are gall , her favours honey
ABAB
a modest maid , deck 'd with a blush of honour
whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love
the wonder of all eyes that look upon her
sacred on earth ; design 'd a saint above
ABAB
chastity and beauty , which are deadly foes
live reconciled friends within her brow
and had she pity to conjoin with those
then who had heard the plaints i utter now
ABAB
iv . thou sawest beauty in the streaking cloud
when grief lift up those eyelids ; nor in scorn
broke ever on thine eyes the purple morn
along the cedar tops ; to thee aloud
ABBA
spake the night solitude , when hushed and bowed
the earth lay at thy feet stony and worn
loving thou markedst when the lamb unshorn
was glad before thee , and amongst the crowd
ABBA
famished and pent in cities did thine eye
read strangest glory — though in human art
no record lives to tell us that thy heart
bowed to its own deep beauty : deeper did lie
ABBA
in vain to deserts thy retreat is made
the muse attends thee to the silent shade
‘ tis hers , the brave man 's latest steps to trace
re judge his acts , and dignify disgrace
AABB
when interest calls off all her sneaking train
when all the obliged desert , and all the vain
she waits ; or , to the scaffold , or the cell
when the last lingering friend has bid farewell
AABB
even now she shades thy evening walk with bays
( no hireling she , no prostitute to praise
even now , observant of the parting ray
eyes the calm sunset of thy various day
AABB
bright windy sunshine and the shadow of cloud
quicken the heavy summer to new birth
of life and motion on the drowsing earth
the huge elms stir , till all the air is loud
ABBA
with their awakening from the muffled sleep
of long hot days . and on the wavering line
that marks the alternate ebb of shade and shine
under the trees , a little group is deep
ABBA
in laughing talk . the shadow as it flows
across them dims the lustre of a rose
quenches the bright clear gold of hair , the green
of a girl 's dress , and life seems faint . the light
AABB
ofttimes i gaze upon thine eyes , fair child
till sense forgets all but the beautiful
and my entranced and raptured heart is full
of blissful visions , pure , and bland , and mild
ABBA
in their o'erstealing , as the rosy sleep
that falls upon an infant , wafting it
in balmy dreams to heaven . within the deep
the thrilling sea of their blue loveliness
ABAB
thine eye the glass where i behold my heart
mine eye the window through the which thine eye
may see my heart , and there thyself espy
in bloody colours how thou painted art
ABBA
thine eye the pile is of a murdering dart
mine eye the sight thou tak'st thy level by
to hit my heart , and never shoot'st awry
mine eye thus helps thine eye to work my smart
ABBA
thine eye a fire is both in heat and light
mine eye of tears a river doth become
o that the water of mine eye had might
to quench the flames that from thine eye doth come
ABAB
when in disgrace with fortune and men 's eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon my self and curse my fate
ABAB
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featured like him , like him with friends possessed
desiring this man 's art , and that man 's scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
ABAB
yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
haply i think on thee , and then my state
( like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth ) sings hymns at heaven 's gate
ABAB
‘ my dearest lord ! farewell , ’ said he , ‘ farewell
heaven bless the king ; may no misfortune tell
the injustice of his hate when i am dead
they 're coming now ; perhaps my guiltless head
AABB
here , in your sight , must then a bleeding lie
and scarce your own stand safe for being nigh
think me not scared with death , howe'er ‘ t appear
i know thou canst not think so : it is a fear
AABB
from which thy love and dammin speaks me free
i 've met him face to face , and ne'er could see
one terror in his looks to make me fly
when virtue bids me stand ; but i would die
AABB
one is a slow and melancholy maid
i know riot if she cometh from the skies
or from the sleepy gulfs , but she will rise
often before me in the twilight shade
ABBA
holding a bunch of poppies and a blade
of springing wheat : prostrate my body lies
before her on the turf , the while she ties
a fillet of the weed about my head
ABBA
and in the gaps of sleep i seem to hear
a gentle rustle like the stir of corn
and words like odours thronging to my ear
“ lie still , beloved — still until the morn
ABAB
and , like a chorus to the words of grace
the ancient fakir , sitting in his place
motionless as an idol and as grim
in the pavilion akbar built for him
AABB
under the court yard trees , ( for he was wise
knew menu 's laws , and through his close shut eyes
saw things far off , and as an open book
into the thoughts of other men could look
AABB
began , half chant , half howling , to rehearse
the fragment of a holy vedic verse
and thus it ran : “ he who all things forgives
conquers himself and all things else , and lives
AABB
“ high words and threats profane this hallowed place
where time rebukes the fuss of human race
and gentle sir , what harm hath he done thee
it is my mother whom he comes to see
AABB
lo , how the gods our puny wrath deride
with peace and beauty spread on every side
this earth with pleasure of the spring complete
too bright to dwell on , were it not so sweet
AABB
no theft of man it 's affluence impairs
a thousand flowers , without a loss , it spares
whose bashful elegance no brush can trace
heartfelt delight , and plenitude of grace
AABB
fond words have oft been spoken to thee , sleep
and thou hast had thy store of tenderest names
the very sweetest words that fancy frames
when thankfulness of heart is strong and deep
ABBA
dear bosom child we call thee , that dost steep
in rich reward all suffering ; balm that tames
all anguish ; saint that evil thoughts and aims
takest away , and into souls dost creep
ABBA
like to a breeze from heaven . shall i alone
i surely not a man ungently made
call thee worst tyrant by which flesh is crost
perverse , self will 'd to own and to disown
ABBA
let not one sparke of filthy lustfull fyre
breake out , that may her sacred peace molest
ne one light glance of sensuall desyre
attempt to work her gentle mindes unrest
ABAB
but pure affections bred in spotlesse brest
and modest thoughts breathd from well tempred spirits
goe visit her in her chaste bowre of rest
accompanyde with á ngelick delightes
ABAB
if thou art tempted by a thought of ill
crave not too soon for victory , nor deem
thou art a coward if thy safety seem
to spring too little from a righteous will
ABBA
for there is nightmare on thee , nor until
thy soul hath caught the morning 's early gleam
seek thou to analyze the monstrous dream
by painful introversion ; rather fill
ABBA
thine eye with forms thou knowest to be truth
but see thou cherish higher hope than this
hope hereafter that thou shall be fit
calm eyed to face distortion , and to sit
AABB
bonny and stout and brown , without a hat
she frowns offended when they call her fat
yet fat she is , the merriest in the place
and all can know she wears a pretty face
AABB
but still she never heeds what praise can say
but does the work , and oft runs out to play
to run about the yard and ramp and noise
and spring the mop upon the servant boys
AABB
when old hens noise and cackle every where
she hurries eager if the eggs are dear
and runs to seek them when they lay away
to get them ready for the market day
AABB
